## System Design Interview Questions for Freshers

### 1. What is CAP theorem?
The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only achieve two out of the three properties:
- **Consistency (C):** Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
- **Availability (A):** Every request receives a response (without a guarantee that it is the most recent data).
- **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate despite network failures causing communication breakdowns between nodes.

In practice, distributed systems must prioritize either **CP (Consistency & Partition Tolerance)** or **AP (Availability & Partition Tolerance)**, as achieving all three simultaneously is not possible.

#### Example:
- **CP System:** A database like HBase ensures strong consistency but may sacrifice availability.
- **AP System:** A system like Cassandra ensures availability but may return stale data due to eventual consistency.

### 2. How is Horizontal scaling different from Vertical scaling?
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more machines or nodes to distribute the load. It enhances system reliability and is commonly used in distributed architectures.

- **Vertical Scaling:** Increasing the capacity of a single machine by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage. It is simpler but has a hardware limitation.

#### Example:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: A load balancer distributing requests among multiple servers.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrading a server’s hardware to handle more traffic.

---

### 3. What is Load Balancing?
Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic or computational workload across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. It enhances performance, reliability, and availability by ensuring efficient resource utilization.

Load balancers act as intermediaries between clients and backend servers, directing requests to the most appropriate server based on various algorithms and metrics such as server load, response time, or round-robin scheduling.

#### Importance of Load Balancing

##### 1. **Improved Performance**
   - Distributes traffic efficiently, reducing response times.
   - Prevents bottlenecks, ensuring smooth user experience.

##### 2. **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**
   - Ensures application uptime by redirecting requests to healthy servers if one fails.
   - Supports redundancy, allowing systems to remain operational during failures.

##### 3. **Scalability**
   - Easily accommodates increased traffic by adding more servers.
   - Helps scale applications horizontally to meet growing user demands.

##### 4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Protects against DDoS attacks by distributing malicious traffic.
   - Masks backend server details, reducing exposure to threats.

##### 5. **Efficient Resource Utilization**
   - Prevents overloading of specific servers while others remain underutilized.
   - Optimizes system resources for better performance and cost efficiency.

##### Load Balancing Algorithms
- **Round Robin:** Distributes requests sequentially to each server.
- **Least Connections:** Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hashing:** Routes requests based on the client's IP address.
- **Weighted Load Balancing:** Assigns traffic proportionally based on server capacity.

##### Types of Load Balancers
- **Hardware Load Balancers:** Dedicated physical devices for traffic distribution.
- **Software Load Balancers:** Implemented using tools like Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-based solutions.
- **DNS Load Balancing:** Uses DNS records to distribute traffic among multiple IPs.

Load balancing is a critical component of modern system design, ensuring high availability, reliability, and performance. By distributing traffic efficiently, it helps prevent failures, optimizes resource usage, and enhances security, making it essential for scalable applications.

### 4. What do you understand by Latency, throughput, and availability of a system?

#### Latency
Latency refers to the time taken for a request to travel from the source to the destination and receive a response. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms) and is crucial for system performance.

##### **Key Factors Affecting Latency:**
- Network delays (packet transmission, routing, congestion)
- Server processing time
- Disk I/O and database query execution time

##### **Ways to Reduce Latency:**
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Optimizing database queries and indexes
- Deploying services closer to users (edge computing)

#### Throughput
Throughput refers to the amount of data or number of requests a system can handle in a given period. It is typically measured in requests per second (RPS) or transactions per second (TPS).

##### **Factors Affecting Throughput:**
- Hardware capabilities (CPU, RAM, Disk speed)
- Network bandwidth
- Concurrency levels and load balancing strategies

##### **Ways to Improve Throughput:**
- Horizontal scaling (adding more servers)
- Efficient load balancing
- Optimizing code and database performance
- Using asynchronous processing and parallelization

#### Availability
Availability refers to the proportion of time a system remains operational and accessible to users. It is typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 99.99% uptime, also known as "four nines").

##### **Factors Affecting Availability:**
- Hardware and software failures
- Network outages
- Load spikes and unexpected traffic surges

##### **Ways to Improve Availability:**
- Implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms
- Using distributed systems and microservices architecture
- Regular monitoring and automated recovery strategies
- Deploying auto-scaling solutions to handle traffic spikes

Understanding latency, throughput, and availability is crucial for designing scalable, reliable, and high-performance systems. Balancing these factors ensures an optimal user experience and system efficiency.

### 5. What is Sharding?
Sharding is a database architecture technique used to horizontally scale databases by distributing data across multiple servers or machines. Instead of storing all data in a single server (which can create bottlenecks as the data grows), sharding splits the data into smaller, more manageable pieces called "shards." Each shard contains a portion of the overall dataset, and the shards are distributed across different servers, allowing for better performance, scalability, and availability.
<br>
In a sharded system, each shard typically holds a subset of the data based on a certain criteria (such as a range of IDs, geographic location, or other relevant attributes). By doing this, the system can handle more queries in parallel, improving response times and system capacity.

#### Key benefits of sharding:
1. **Improved Scalability**: As the amount of data grows, additional shards can be added, enabling the database to scale horizontally.
2. **Performance**: Distributing data across multiple servers can reduce the load on a single machine and allow for better query performance.
3. **High Availability**: Sharding can contribute to system reliability by isolating issues to specific shards, preventing them from affecting the entire database.

However, sharding introduces complexity in data management, including ensuring proper distribution of data, handling cross-shard queries, and maintaining consistency across shards.

### 6. How is NoSQL database different from SQL databases?

NoSQL and SQL databases differ in several key ways, particularly in their structure, data models, scalability, and use cases. Here’s a breakdown of the main differences:

#### 1. **Data Model:**
   - **SQL (Relational Databases):**
     - Use a structured schema with tables, rows, and columns.
     - Data is organized into fixed schemas, meaning the structure of the data must be predefined (e.g., defining tables and relationships between them in advance).
     - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
   
   - **NoSQL (Non-relational Databases):**
     - More flexible and can store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.
     - There are different types of NoSQL databases:
       - **Document-oriented:** Stores data in JSON or BSON format (e.g., MongoDB).
       - **Key-Value Stores:** Stores data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis).
       - **Column-family Stores:** Organizes data in columns instead of rows (e.g., Cassandra).
       - **Graph Databases:** Focus on relationships between data entities (e.g., Neo4j).

#### 2. **Schema Flexibility:**
   - **SQL:**
     - Schema is fixed and rigid, meaning that changes to the structure (e.g., adding columns or altering data types) can be complex and require careful planning.
   
   - **NoSQL:**
     - Schema-less or flexible schema, meaning you can store different types of data in the same collection without predefined structures.
     - You can easily change the structure of data without downtime.

#### 3. **Scalability:**
   - **SQL:**
     - Primarily scales vertically (adding more power to a single server), which can be expensive and has limitations as data grows.
   
   - **NoSQL:**
     - Designed to scale horizontally (adding more servers), making it easier to handle large volumes of data and traffic by distributing data across multiple machines.

#### 4. **Transactions and Consistency:**
   - **SQL:**
     - Follows ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring strong consistency and reliability for transactions.
   
   - **NoSQL:**
     - Often sacrifices ACID properties for better performance and scalability. Many NoSQL databases follow the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) model, focusing on availability and eventual consistency over immediate consistency.

#### 5. **Query Language:**
   - **SQL:**
     - Uses SQL (Structured Query Language), which is standardized and powerful for performing complex queries, joins, and transactions.
   
   - **NoSQL:**
     - Uses various query languages or APIs depending on the type of NoSQL database. For example, MongoDB uses its own query language based on JSON-like syntax, while Redis uses commands to interact with data.

#### 6. **Use Cases:**
   - **SQL:**
     - Well-suited for applications with structured data and complex relationships, such as financial applications, e-commerce platforms, and data warehousing.
   
   - **NoSQL:**
     - Ideal for applications with unstructured or semi-structured data, high scalability requirements, and rapidly evolving data models, such as social media, big data analytics, content management, and IoT.

#### 7. **Performance:**
   - **SQL:**
     - Can experience performance bottlenecks as the database grows, especially when scaling vertically.
   
   - **NoSQL:**
     - Designed for high-performance in distributed environments, making it well-suited for applications that handle large-scale, real-time data processing.

##### 8. **Example Databases:**
   - **SQL:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.
   - **NoSQL:** MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis, Neo4j, Firebase.

##### **Pros:**
- **SQL databases** are great for structured data with well-defined relationships and are typically used for applications that require strong consistency, complex queries, and transactions.
- **NoSQL databases** are more flexible, scalable, and better suited for applications that need to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data with varying schema over time, often at the cost of strict consistency.

### 7. How is sharding different from partitioning?
Sharding and partitioning are both techniques used to divide and distribute data across multiple servers or storage units to improve scalability, performance, and availability. However, there are key differences in how they are implemented and used.

#### 1. **Definition:**
   - **Sharding:**
     - Sharding is a specific type of database partitioning where data is split into smaller, more manageable pieces, called "shards." Each shard is stored on a different server or node, and each shard contains a subset of the data. Sharding is typically used in distributed databases to enable horizontal scaling.
     - In sharding, the data is usually distributed based on a specific criterion, such as range of IDs or geographical location.

   - **Partitioning:**
     - Partitioning refers to the general practice of dividing data into multiple parts, or partitions, to improve query performance, data management, or scalability. Partitioning can occur within a single database server (intra-server partitioning) or across multiple servers (inter-server partitioning).
     - Partitioning can be done by different methods such as range-based partitioning, list-based partitioning, or hash-based partitioning.

#### 2. **Scope:**
   - **Sharding:**
     - Sharding specifically refers to distributing the data across multiple databases or servers. Each shard is independent and has its own set of resources (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) and can handle queries independently.
     - Sharding is typically implemented in distributed systems where the database must scale horizontally.

   - **Partitioning:**
     - Partitioning can occur within a single database instance, or it can be spread across multiple instances. When partitioning within a single instance, it’s often done for performance or management reasons, but it does not necessarily involve distributing the data across multiple servers.
     - Partitioning can be a part of a sharding strategy, but it is not always required to distribute data across different servers.

#### 3. **Data Distribution:**
   - **Sharding:**
     - In sharding, the data is divided into shards, and each shard is typically stored on a separate server or machine. Each shard is independent and may be located in different data centers, often based on the sharding key.
     - Shards are generally designed to work independently, and the system handles distributing the load and managing queries across shards.

   - **Partitioning:**
     - Partitioning may involve dividing data into parts (partitions) based on certain rules, but these partitions are often still located within the same database server.
     - In some cases, partitioning can be done within a single server with different partitions corresponding to different subsets of data (e.g., partitioning data by date, region, or product category).

#### 4. **Management Complexity:**
   - **Sharding:**
     - Sharding is more complex because it requires managing multiple independent databases or servers. This introduces complexities such as cross-shard queries, balancing load across shards, and ensuring data consistency across distributed systems.
     - Sharding often requires specific configurations for distributed transactions, replication, and data rebalancing.

   - **Partitioning:**
     - Partitioning within a single database is usually less complex because it doesn’t involve managing multiple servers or independent databases. However, partitioning still requires understanding how data is divided and ensuring queries are optimized to access the correct partitions.
     - Partitioning can usually be done with minimal changes to the database structure and can often be managed with built-in database features.

#### 5. **Use Case:**
   - **Sharding:**
     - Sharding is commonly used in distributed databases that need to handle very large datasets and scale horizontally, such as NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) or even SQL databases in some cases.
     - It is used when you need to scale a system across many servers to handle large amounts of traffic and data.

   - **Partitioning:**
     - Partitioning is typically used to improve performance or manageability within a single database server or to divide data logically based on certain criteria (e.g., time-based partitioning or region-based partitioning).
     - It is useful for improving query performance, maintenance tasks (like backups or index rebuilding), or simply for organizing data better.

#### 6. **Example:**
   - **Sharding:**
     - In a large-scale e-commerce application, you might shard customer data by region (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) and store each region's data in separate databases or servers.
     - A query to fetch all orders from North America will only be directed to the North American shard, thus reducing load on other shards.

   - **Partitioning:**
     - In a relational database, you might partition a sales table by year, where data for each year is stored in a different partition within the same server or database instance. This helps optimize queries by narrowing the scope of data being scanned.

##### Pros:
- **Sharding** is a type of horizontal partitioning where the data is divided across multiple servers or nodes, usually in a distributed system, and each shard is independent.
- **Partitioning** refers to dividing data into smaller parts (partitions), which may be on the same server or across multiple servers, and it’s used for performance optimization and easier data management.

While both techniques aim to distribute data for better performance, **sharding** focuses on distributing data across multiple independent servers, whereas **partitioning** can involve splitting data into smaller chunks for organizational or performance benefits within the same server or database.

### 8. How is performance and scalability related to each other?
Performance and scalability are closely related but represent different aspects of how a system or application behaves under various conditions. Here’s how they are connected:

#### 1. **Definition of Performance:**
   - **Performance** refers to how efficiently a system operates in terms of responsiveness, speed, and resource usage. It’s typically measured by factors like:
     - **Latency** (how quickly a system responds to a request)
     - **Throughput** (how much work or how many requests the system can handle over time)
     - **Resource Utilization** (how efficiently the system uses CPU, memory, disk, and network resources)

   Performance is a measure of how well a system performs under typical or expected conditions, such as how quickly a database can return a query or how fast a web page loads.

#### 2. **Definition of Scalability:**
   - **Scalability** refers to the system's ability to handle increased load or traffic by efficiently expanding resources. It is the capacity of a system to grow and accommodate larger amounts of data, users, or requests without significant degradation in performance.
     - **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):** Adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to an existing server.
     - **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):** Adding more servers or machines to distribute the load.

   Scalability is often tested by increasing the load (more users, more data, more requests) and observing how well the system adapts to this change.

#### 3. **Relationship Between Performance and Scalability:**

   - **Scalability Improves Performance Under Load:**
     - Scalability directly impacts performance in scenarios where the system is experiencing high load or traffic. If a system is scalable, it can adapt to increased demand by distributing the load across additional resources (e.g., servers, nodes, databases). This can help maintain or even improve performance as the load increases.
     - For example, when a web application experiences a surge in traffic, horizontal scaling (adding more servers) can ensure that response times stay low, even though more users are accessing the system.

   - **Performance is Often a Measure of Scalability:**
     - When a system is tested for scalability, its performance is a key factor. If the system can handle more users or data while maintaining low latency and high throughput, it is considered scalable.
     - In systems that are not scalable, adding more traffic can lead to a decrease in performance (e.g., slower response times, higher error rates). This is because the system becomes overwhelmed and cannot allocate enough resources to handle the load efficiently.

   - **Performance as a Bottleneck to Scalability:**
     - Poor performance can limit scalability. For instance, if a system is not optimized for performance (e.g., slow database queries, inefficient algorithms), adding more servers or resources may not result in the desired scalability. The system may still be slow due to inherent inefficiencies, even though it has the capacity to handle more load.
     - For example, if a database query is inefficient, scaling out to more database servers won’t significantly improve the overall performance since each server will still execute the same inefficient query.

   - **Trade-offs Between Performance and Scalability:**
     - There are often trade-offs between performance and scalability, especially when scaling horizontally. For instance, a distributed system might have to deal with network latency when communicating between nodes, which can affect the system's performance even as it scales.
     - Additionally, achieving scalability might require additional complexity, such as load balancing, sharding, or partitioning, which can add overhead and slightly affect performance.

#### 4. **Examples of How Scalability Affects Performance:**
   - **Web Applications:**
     - A web application with millions of users needs to scale horizontally (e.g., adding more web servers) to handle the increased number of requests. Without this scalability, the performance would degrade, and users would experience slow load times or timeouts.
   - **Database Systems:**
     - A relational database may experience slower query performance as data grows. To maintain performance under increased load, the database might need to be scaled (e.g., through partitioning or sharding). Sharding can improve performance by distributing the load across multiple servers, ensuring that the system scales without significant performance degradation.
   - **Cloud Systems:**
     - Cloud-based applications often rely on elastic scaling (automatically adding resources as needed). Performance can remain optimal, even during traffic spikes, because the system scales in real time to meet demand, preventing slowdowns or crashes.

#### 5. **Balancing Performance and Scalability:**
   - **Optimization First, Then Scaling:** Achieving good performance through optimization (e.g., code optimization, caching, database indexing) is often the first step before scaling. Once a system is optimized, scaling becomes more effective and results in better performance at larger scales.
   - **Testing Under Load:** Scalability can be tested through load testing and stress testing, where the system is subjected to increased demand, and its performance is measured. This helps identify bottlenecks and determine how much additional load the system can handle without significant performance degradation.

##### **Pros**:
- **Performance** refers to how efficiently a system works under typical conditions, focusing on speed, responsiveness, and resource usage.
- **Scalability** is the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources without significant drops in performance.
- A system must be scalable to maintain good performance as demand increases, but performance optimization must be in place before scaling to ensure the system scales effectively.
- In essence, scalability and performance are interdependent: good performance allows for better scalability, and proper scalability ensures that performance does not degrade when the system is under higher load.

### 9. What is Caching? What are the various cache update strategies available in caching?

**Caching** is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area (called a "cache") so that it can be retrieved more quickly. The cache acts as an intermediary storage between a slower data source (like a database, API, or file system) and the application, improving performance by reducing the time it takes to access frequently used data.
<br>
In caching, when a request is made for data, the system first checks if the data is already in the cache. If it is, the data is returned from the cache, which is much faster than retrieving it from the original data source. If the data is not found in the cache (a cache miss), it is retrieved from the data source and then stored in the cache for future use (a cache hit).

#### Benefits of Caching:
- **Improved performance**: By reducing the need to repeatedly fetch data from slower data sources.
- **Reduced load**: Less frequent access to the primary data source, leading to reduced resource consumption.
- **Lower latency**: Faster data retrieval as cached data is typically stored in memory, which is much faster than disk storage or remote servers.

#### Types of Cache:
1. **In-memory Caching**: Stores data in the system's memory (RAM), which is very fast. Examples: Redis, Memcached.
2. **Disk-based Caching**: Data is stored on disk but optimized for faster retrieval than the original data source. Examples: Varnish, Apache Traffic Server.
3. **Distributed Caching**: Caching is spread across multiple servers or nodes, allowing for horizontal scaling. Examples: Redis Cluster, Amazon ElastiCache.


#### Cache Update Strategies:

When data in the cache becomes outdated or stale, it needs to be updated. There are several strategies for updating or invalidating cached data:

1. **Cache Invalidation**:
   - **Description**: The cached data is marked as invalid or deleted when the underlying data source changes, forcing the system to fetch fresh data next time.
   - **Strategy**:
     - **Explicit Invalidation**: The cache is explicitly invalidated when a change happens (e.g., when a user updates a record in the database, the cache for that record is deleted).
     - **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: The cache has a fixed expiration time, and once the time is up, the cached data is invalidated automatically, forcing a refresh.
     - **Event-driven Invalidation**: The cache is invalidated based on certain events, such as database updates, user actions, or system events.

2. **Cache Write-Through**:
   - **Description**: In this strategy, every time data is updated in the primary data store (e.g., a database), it is also updated in the cache. This ensures the cache always holds the most recent data.
   - **Strategy**: Data is written to both the cache and the underlying data store at the same time, keeping them in sync.
   - **Advantages**: The cache always contains fresh data, ensuring consistency between the cache and the data store.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can be slower than other strategies since every write requires a write to both the cache and the data store.

3. **Cache Write-Behind (or Write-Back)**:
   - **Description**: Data is first written to the cache and then asynchronously written to the primary data store after some delay. This can reduce the load on the data store since updates to the data source are batched.
   - **Strategy**: Writes are made to the cache immediately, and the system later writes the changes to the database after a predefined interval or when the cache is evicted.
   - **Advantages**: Reduces the number of write operations to the data store, improving system performance.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can lead to data inconsistency between the cache and the primary data store if the system crashes before the data is written back.

4. **Cache Eviction**:
   - **Description**: The cache automatically removes old or unused data to make room for new data. This is important in memory-limited environments.
   - **Strategies**:
     - **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: The least recently used data is evicted first when the cache becomes full.
     - **Least Frequently Used (LFU)**: Data that is accessed the least often is evicted first.
     - **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**: The data that was cached first is evicted first.
     - **Random Eviction**: Randomly evicts data from the cache to make space for new data.
   - **Advantages**: Ensures that only the most relevant data stays in the cache, improving cache hit rates.
   - **Disadvantages**: May result in stale or outdated data if not handled carefully.

5. **Lazy Caching (Lazy Loading)**:
   - **Description**: The cache is only updated when data is actually requested (a cache miss). If the data is not found in the cache, it is fetched from the underlying data store and added to the cache for future use.
   - **Strategy**: Data is loaded into the cache only when it is needed, and no data is loaded proactively.
   - **Advantages**: Can save memory, as only the data that's actually requested is cached.
   - **Disadvantages**: Increases the time to retrieve data the first time, as the system needs to fetch the data from the primary data source.

6. **Hybrid Caching**:
   - **Description**: Combines multiple caching strategies to address different use cases or requirements. For example, write-through for frequently updated data and lazy caching for less frequently updated data.
   - **Strategy**: Different cache update strategies are applied depending on the type of data, frequency of updates, or usage patterns.
   - **Advantages**: Can optimize performance and consistency based on the characteristics of the data.
   - **Disadvantages**: More complex to implement and manage.

### 10. What are the various Consistency patterns available in system design?
In system design, **consistency** refers to how well a distributed system ensures that all copies of a given piece of data reflect the same value across the system, even in the face of failures or network partitions. Different **consistency patterns** define how this synchronization happens in the system, especially in distributed systems where multiple replicas or nodes exist.

#### Consistency patterns commonly used in system design:

##### 1. **Strong Consistency**
   - **Definition**: A system is said to have strong consistency if, after a write operation, all subsequent read operations return the latest written value. Every read reflects the most recent write, and all clients see the same value for a piece of data at any point in time.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Guarantees that all replicas of data are in sync and provide the most up-to-date information immediately after a write.
     - Often involves locking mechanisms or coordinated protocols to ensure that the latest write is propagated across all replicas before reading.
   - **Example**: A typical example of strong consistency is a relational database, where if a value is updated, the new value is immediately available to all users.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can lead to performance bottlenecks and higher latency because the system has to wait for all nodes to acknowledge the update before returning a response to the client.

##### 2. **Eventual Consistency**
   - **Definition**: Eventual consistency ensures that, given enough time, all replicas of a piece of data will eventually converge to the same value. However, at any given moment, different replicas might return different values.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - There are no guarantees that reads will return the latest write, but the system will eventually propagate updates to all replicas.
     - Suitable for scenarios where it's acceptable to serve stale or inconsistent data temporarily, and data synchronization can occur asynchronously.
   - **Example**: Systems like Amazon DynamoDB and Cassandra provide eventual consistency. They allow for high availability and partition tolerance but may not always return the most recent write.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can lead to temporary inconsistency between replicas, which may be problematic for applications that require immediate consistency (e.g., financial systems).

##### 3. **Weak Consistency**
   - **Definition**: Weak consistency allows for more flexibility than eventual consistency, in that there are no guarantees on when or whether updates will be seen by all replicas. The system may not even guarantee that all reads will eventually reflect all writes.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Offers no consistency guarantees, but provides higher availability and lower latency.
     - Can be useful for applications where the consistency of data is not crucial, and availability or performance is more important.
   - **Example**: Some NoSQL databases or caches (like Memcached) may provide weak consistency where replicas are not guaranteed to converge or synchronize.
   - **Disadvantages**: The system may return outdated or conflicting data, which can be problematic in certain use cases where consistency is important.

##### 4. **Causal Consistency**
   - **Definition**: Causal consistency ensures that operations that are causally related are seen by all nodes in the same order. If one operation causally influences another, all nodes will see them in the same order. However, operations that are independent of each other may be seen in a different order by different replicas.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - This pattern allows for greater concurrency while maintaining the order of causally related operations.
     - It is a middle ground between strong consistency and eventual consistency.
   - **Example**: Systems that implement a version of causal consistency might use timestamps or vector clocks to track the causal relationship between events (e.g., Riak or some versions of Amazon DynamoDB).
   - **Disadvantages**: Ensuring causal consistency can be complex to implement and may require additional overhead for tracking causal relationships.

##### 5. **Read-Your-Writes Consistency**
   - **Definition**: This consistency model ensures that once a client performs a write operation, any subsequent read operations by that client will reflect that write, even if the write hasn't been fully propagated across the system yet.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Guarantees that a client sees its own updates, even if the updates are not yet visible to other clients.
     - This consistency model is useful in scenarios where a user interacts with the data, and the system should guarantee that the user's view is always consistent with their actions.
   - **Example**: A typical example could be an online banking system where after transferring money, the user is guaranteed to see their updated balance, even if other users haven't yet seen the change.
   - **Disadvantages**: This approach can lead to inconsistency between different clients, especially in systems with high concurrency or network partitions.

##### 6. **Monotonic Read Consistency**
   - **Definition**: Monotonic read consistency ensures that once a client reads a value, any subsequent reads will either return the same value or a more recent one. It prevents "reading backwards" (i.e., seeing an earlier version of data after seeing a more recent version).
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Prevents inconsistencies where a client might see a value and then, in subsequent reads, see an earlier value.
     - Suitable for systems where the user expects that the data they’ve seen won’t regress (e.g., social media feeds, email inboxes).
   - **Example**: A social network where a user scrolls down a feed and is guaranteed to see newer posts as they load more data.
   - **Disadvantages**: Implementing monotonic reads may require extra coordination to track the last-read version of data for each client, adding complexity.

##### 7. **Session Consistency**
   - **Definition**: Session consistency ensures that within the context of a single session, the system guarantees that a user will always see their own writes (similar to read-your-writes consistency), even if the system uses eventual consistency for other users.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - It ensures that during the lifetime of a session, a user’s operations are consistent, even though the system might not guarantee consistency across all users.
     - This is useful in scenarios where the consistency of a user's actions is important, but the system can allow more flexibility for other users.
   - **Example**: A user modifying their profile on a website will always see their updates, even though other users may not immediately see them.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can lead to temporary inconsistencies between different users, especially in systems with high concurrency.

##### 8. **Linearizability (Strong Consistency)**
   - **Definition**: Linearizability is a stronger form of consistency where all operations appear to happen instantaneously at some point between their invocation and their response. This ensures that every operation on the system is serializable and happens in a globally agreed-upon order.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Linearizability guarantees that the system behaves as if the operations were happening one after the other in a global order, providing strong consistency for distributed systems.
     - It requires synchronization between all replicas, which can introduce performance bottlenecks.
   - **Example**: Distributed systems such as Google Spanner and ZooKeeper implement linearizability for critical operations.
   - **Disadvantages**: It can have high latency and reduced throughput due to the strong synchronization requirements.

#### Choosing the Right Consistency Model:

When designing a distributed system, you need to choose the appropriate consistency model based on the application’s needs. This often involves trade-offs between **CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance)**, as well as the nature of your data, traffic patterns, and fault tolerance requirements.

- **Strong Consistency**: Ideal for applications where data correctness and freshness are critical (e.g., financial systems, inventory systems).
- **Eventual Consistency**: Suitable for applications where high availability and scalability are more important than absolute consistency (e.g., social media platforms, content delivery networks).
- **Causal Consistency**: Useful for applications that need to preserve causal relationships but can tolerate some level of inconsistency (e.g., collaborative editing tools, messaging apps).
- **Session Consistency**: Best suited for applications where users should always see their own changes during a session (e.g., e-commerce, personalized settings).

### 11. What do you understand by Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a system of distributed servers that work together to deliver digital content (such as web pages, images, videos, and other media) to users more efficiently. The primary goal of a CDN is to improve the speed, availability, and reliability of content delivery by caching content closer to the user’s geographic location.

#### Key Concepts of a CDN:

1. **Distributed Servers**:
   - CDNs use a network of servers located in different geographic regions. These servers, known as **edge servers**, store cached versions of content. The closer a user is to an edge server, the faster they can access the content.

2. **Caching**:
   - CDNs cache static content like images, JavaScript, CSS, and videos on their servers. When a user requests content, the CDN serves it from the server closest to them, reducing latency and speeding up load times.

3. **Geographical Proximity**:
   - The content is replicated across multiple data centers located in different regions worldwide. This ensures that the content is served from a server that is geographically closer to the user, reducing the round-trip time for data and improving performance.

4. **Load Balancing**:
   - CDNs use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers. This helps prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring high availability and preventing bottlenecks.

5. **Content Offloading**:
   - By serving cached content, CDNs offload traffic from the origin server, reducing the load on the main server and improving its scalability. This is particularly important during traffic spikes, such as product launches or viral events.

6. **Dynamic and Static Content**:
   - CDNs typically cache **static content** (like images, videos, and stylesheets) but may also handle **dynamic content** (like personalized user data or real-time information) in some cases, either by caching dynamic responses or routing requests to the origin server as needed.

#### Benefits of Using a CDN:

1. **Improved Load Times**:
   - By caching content closer to the user’s location, CDNs reduce the time it takes to load a webpage or stream media. This results in faster response times and a better user experience.

2. **Reduced Latency**:
   - CDNs minimize latency by serving content from a server closer to the user, ensuring faster access and better performance, especially for global audiences.

3. **Increased Availability and Reliability**:
   - CDNs improve content availability by providing redundancy. If one server fails, traffic can be rerouted to the next nearest server, ensuring high availability and reducing downtime.

4. **Scalability**:
   - CDNs help handle traffic spikes by distributing the load across multiple servers, allowing websites to scale effortlessly during high demand periods without crashing.

5. **Global Reach**:
   - CDNs provide global reach by ensuring content is available to users in any part of the world, making it ideal for businesses with a global user base.

6. **Security**:
   - CDNs can enhance security through **DDoS protection**, SSL/TLS encryption, and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). They can also help protect the origin server by acting as a buffer between the user and the server, preventing direct attacks.

7. **Reduced Bandwidth Costs**:
   - By caching and serving content from edge servers, CDNs reduce the amount of data transferred from the origin server, which can lower bandwidth costs for the website owner.

#### How a CDN Works:
1. **Caching Content**: When content is requested for the first time, the CDN caches it on an edge server close to the user. The content is then served to the user from that cache.
2. **Content Delivery**: For subsequent requests, the CDN delivers the content from the nearest edge server, rather than fetching it from the origin server.
3. **Cache Expiry**: Cached content is typically stored for a set period (determined by TTL – Time to Live). Once the cache expires, the content is refreshed from the origin server or the content provider.

#### Common Use Cases for a CDN:
- **Website Acceleration**: CDNs are widely used to speed up websites by delivering static content from nearby servers, reducing load times.
- **Video Streaming**: CDNs are essential for delivering high-quality, buffer-free video streaming experiences to users across the world.
- **Software Distribution**: CDNs are used to distribute software downloads, patches, and updates efficiently to large numbers of users.
- **E-commerce**: E-commerce sites use CDNs to handle high volumes of traffic, especially during sales or promotions, ensuring fast load times and a smooth user experience.

#### Examples of Popular CDN Providers:
- **Cloudflare**
- **Akamai**
- **Amazon CloudFront**
- **Fastly**
- **KeyCDN**
- **StackPath (formerly MaxCDN)**

### 12. What do you understand by Leader Election?
**Leader Election** is a distributed computing concept used to designate a single node (or process) as the "leader" among a set of nodes in a distributed system. The leader node is typically responsible for coordinating actions, making decisions, and performing critical tasks within the system. Leader election ensures that the system has one and only one leader at any given time, and if the leader fails, a new leader is elected to maintain system consistency and availability.

Leader election is important in distributed systems for achieving tasks like data replication, consensus, resource allocation, and coordination among nodes. The process helps prevent conflicts and inconsistencies by ensuring a clear point of authority for decision-making.

#### Key Aspects of Leader Election:
1. **Uniqueness**: There should always be exactly one leader at any given time. If there are multiple leaders, it can lead to conflicts and inconsistencies.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: If the leader node fails (due to network partition, crash, or other failures), a new leader must be elected to replace it, ensuring the system continues functioning smoothly.
3. **Fairness**: All nodes in the system should have a fair opportunity to be elected as the leader, and the election process should avoid favoritism or bias.

#### Common Use Cases for Leader Election:
- **Distributed Databases**: To ensure a consistent point for managing transactions or replication (e.g., leader for handling write requests in a primary-replica database model).
- **Coordination**: In distributed applications like microservices, leader election helps coordinate tasks between multiple nodes, such as task scheduling or managing shared resources.
- **Consistency and Consensus**: In distributed algorithms (like Paxos or Raft), leader election helps establish a coordinator for ensuring that all nodes in the system agree on a certain value or decision.
- **High Availability**: In systems with high availability requirements, leader election allows the system to quickly recover from leader failures and maintain system uptime.

#### Leader Election Algorithms:
There are several algorithms that help in electing a leader in a distributed system. Some of the popular ones include:

1. **Bully Algorithm**:
   - In the Bully Algorithm, the nodes in the system are assigned unique IDs. When a node detects that the leader has failed, it sends messages to the other nodes with a higher ID, "bullying" them to step down and allow it to take over as the leader. The node with the highest ID eventually becomes the leader.
   - **Advantages**: Simple and effective in systems with small numbers of nodes.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can be inefficient for larger systems as it requires a lot of message-passing between nodes.

2. **Ring Algorithm**:
   - In this algorithm, nodes are arranged in a logical ring, and a token (a special message) is passed around the ring. Each node has an ID, and when the leader fails, the token is passed until the node with the highest ID claims leadership.
   - **Advantages**: Less message overhead compared to the Bully algorithm.
   - **Disadvantages**: Node failures can cause the ring to break, requiring special handling.

3. **Paxos Algorithm**:
   - Paxos is a consensus algorithm designed to achieve leader election and agreement in a distributed system. It uses a proposal-based mechanism where a majority of nodes must agree on a value (which can be a leader) before it is accepted.
   - **Advantages**: Strong consistency and fault tolerance.
   - **Disadvantages**: Complex and can have performance bottlenecks due to the need for multiple rounds of communication.

4. **Raft Algorithm**:
   - Raft is a consensus algorithm that simplifies the leader election process compared to Paxos. In Raft, nodes continuously elect a leader through a voting process. If the current leader fails, new elections are triggered.
   - **Advantages**: Easier to understand and implement compared to Paxos, and it provides strong consistency and fault tolerance.
   - **Disadvantages**: Requires reliable communication and may have some overhead in large distributed systems.

5. **Zookeeper’s ZAB Protocol**:
   - Apache Zookeeper, a widely used coordination service, uses the **Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast (ZAB)** protocol to manage leader election in a distributed system. ZAB ensures that the leader is elected from a quorum of nodes and guarantees that once a leader is elected, it remains the leader until a new election is needed.
   - **Advantages**: Robust and fault-tolerant; ensures consistency in distributed systems.
   - **Disadvantages**: It can be complex to manage, especially as the system scales.

#### Challenges in Leader Election:
- **Network Partitions**: When the network is partitioned (e.g., when some nodes can’t communicate with others), leader election algorithms must ensure that only one leader is elected in a partitioned system and avoid the risk of multiple leaders being elected in different parts of the network.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If the leader crashes or is otherwise unavailable, a new leader must be elected quickly, and the system must handle potential failures gracefully to maintain consistency and avoid downtime.
- **Scalability**: As the system grows, the leader election process must scale to handle large numbers of nodes and maintain efficiency.

#### Example of Leader Election in Practice:
- **Distributed Databases**: In a distributed database, leader election is used to determine the **primary replica** for handling write requests. For instance, in a **master-slave replication model**, the master node is elected as the leader and is responsible for handling write operations, while the slaves serve as replicas for read operations. If the master node fails, a new leader is elected from the available slaves.
  
- **Microservices Coordination**: In a system where multiple services need to perform a specific task (e.g., batch processing), leader election can be used to ensure that only one service instance takes responsibility for the task at a time, preventing conflicts and ensuring synchronization.

#### Summary:
Leader election is a critical concept in distributed systems, ensuring that a single node is chosen as the leader to coordinate tasks, manage resources, and make decisions. The leader election process provides fault tolerance, scalability, and consistency in distributed systems, and several algorithms (e.g., Bully, Paxos, Raft, ZAB) are used to elect a leader based on the system’s needs.

### 14. What are some of the design issues in distributed systems?

Designing distributed systems involves addressing several key challenges and issues due to the inherent complexity of coordinating multiple components across different machines or locations. These issues can affect the system's performance, scalability, reliability, consistency, and maintainability. 

#### Common design issues in distributed systems:

##### 1. **Network Communication and Latency**
   - **Issue**: Communication between distributed components can incur significant delays due to network latency, bandwidth limitations, and packet loss. These factors can affect the performance of the system.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Use techniques like **caching** to reduce redundant network calls.
     - Implement **asynchronous communication** to avoid blocking operations.
     - Optimize data transmission with **compression** and **data serialization** formats (e.g., Protobuf, Avro).
     - Minimize the number of communication hops or choose geographically closer servers.

##### 2. **Fault Tolerance and Reliability**
   - **Issue**: Nodes, networks, and components in a distributed system can fail independently, leading to partial system failures or downtime.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Replication**: Store copies of data across multiple nodes to ensure availability even in the event of a node failure.
     - **Redundancy**: Design for redundancy in critical components (e.g., load balancers, databases).
     - **Failover mechanisms**: Implement automatic failover, where a backup system or node takes over in case of failure.
     - **Heartbeat monitoring**: Periodically check node health and switch traffic to healthy instances when needed.

##### 3. **Consistency vs. Availability (CAP Theorem)**
   - **Issue**: The **CAP Theorem** states that in a distributed system, you can achieve only two of the following three properties simultaneously: **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance**. This presents a trade-off in how the system behaves in case of network partitioning.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Eventual consistency**: In cases where **strong consistency** is not critical, eventual consistency can be used to ensure high availability.
     - **Quorum-based approaches** (e.g., Paxos, Raft) to ensure consistency during network partitions.
     - **Read/write consistency**: Decide whether the system needs to prioritize consistency for reads or writes and adapt strategies accordingly.

##### 4. **Data Partitioning and Sharding**
   - **Issue**: As data grows, it becomes impractical to store everything on a single node or database. **Sharding** (splitting data across multiple machines) introduces complexities like data distribution, balancing load, and querying across shards.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Hash-based sharding**: Use a hash function to map data to different nodes, ensuring an even distribution of data.
     - **Range-based sharding**: Divide data into ranges (e.g., by timestamp or alphabetically) and store them in different nodes.
     - Ensure **rebalancing** strategies to handle data growth and distribution across shards.

##### 5. **Concurrency and Synchronization**
   - **Issue**: In a distributed system, multiple nodes may try to access shared resources concurrently, leading to race conditions, data corruption, and other issues.
   - **Solution**:
     - Implement **locks** (e.g., distributed locks) to ensure mutual exclusion.
     - Use **transactions** with isolation levels to manage concurrency (e.g., ACID properties in databases).
     - Apply **optimistic concurrency control** for read-heavy operations, where conflicts are resolved later, rather than locking resources in advance.

##### 6. **Distributed Consensus**
   - **Issue**: Achieving consensus among distributed nodes on decisions, such as electing a leader, agreeing on the order of transactions, or ensuring that all nodes have the same view of data, is challenging in the face of failures and network partitions.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use **consensus algorithms** like **Paxos**, **Raft**, or **Zab** to ensure that nodes can agree on a common value despite failures and network issues.
     - Ensure fault tolerance during the consensus process by leveraging majority voting and handling conflicting states or messages.

##### 7. **Data Consistency**
   - **Issue**: Ensuring that all replicas of a distributed system’s data are synchronized and consistent, especially in the face of node failures or network partitions, is challenging.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Strong consistency**: Use synchronous replication, where writes are acknowledged by all replicas before being considered complete.
     - **Eventual consistency**: Allow some flexibility in consistency, ensuring that the system eventually converges to a consistent state after a period of time.
     - **Conflict resolution**: Design mechanisms for resolving conflicts (e.g., last-write-wins, versioning).

##### 8. **Scalability**
   - **Issue**: A distributed system should be able to handle increasing loads (in terms of data, users, or requests) without significant degradation in performance.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Horizontal scaling**: Add more nodes or machines to the system as the demand increases.
     - **Load balancing**: Distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances to avoid bottlenecks.
     - **Elasticity**: Use cloud-based solutions or container orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes) that automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.

##### 9. **Latency and Performance Optimization**
   - **Issue**: Distributed systems often suffer from latency due to network communication, especially when nodes are geographically distant.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data in memory (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce the need for repeated network calls.
     - **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Use CDNs to cache static content close to the user’s location and reduce load times.
     - **Compression**: Compress data before transmission to reduce bandwidth consumption.

##### 10. **Security and Privacy**
   - **Issue**: Securing communication between nodes and protecting sensitive data in a distributed environment is a challenge, especially when data is replicated across multiple servers.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Encryption**: Encrypt data both at rest and in transit (e.g., using TLS/SSL for communication).
     - **Authentication and Authorization**: Use distributed authentication systems (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to verify identities and ensure proper access control.
     - **Auditing and Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring mechanisms to track access and identify security breaches.

##### 11. **Service Discovery and Fault Isolation**
   - **Issue**: In a dynamic environment where services can scale up or down, or fail and recover, it is difficult to keep track of the current locations and statuses of services.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use **service discovery** tools (e.g., Consul, Eureka) to maintain a registry of services and their addresses.
     - Implement **health checks** and automatic failover to redirect traffic away from unhealthy services.

##### 12. **Global Distribution**
   - **Issue**: Managing a distributed system that spans multiple data centers across different geographic regions introduces challenges related to network partitioning, consistency, and latency.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use **geo-replication** to replicate data across data centers in different regions.
     - Design for **locality of reference**, ensuring that users are served by the closest data center.
     - Handle **network partitions** using partition-tolerant strategies like eventual consistency or quorum-based replication.

##### 13. **Versioning and Upgrades**
   - **Issue**: As the system evolves, different versions of services or components may need to coexist, and updates or migrations need to be handled without disrupting the system.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use **canary releases** or **blue-green deployments** to test new versions gradually.
     - Ensure backward compatibility for APIs and data formats.
     - Employ **feature toggles** to enable or disable features dynamically without requiring system downtime.

##### 14. **Distributed Debugging and Monitoring**
   - **Issue**: Debugging and monitoring distributed systems can be difficult because errors may manifest across multiple nodes or services, and logs may be spread across different locations.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use **centralized logging** tools (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to aggregate logs from all nodes.
     - Implement **distributed tracing** (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) to track requests across services and identify performance bottlenecks.

##### Tip:
Designing distributed systems requires addressing several challenges related to **network communication**, **fault tolerance**, **data consistency**, **scalability**, and **security**. Solutions to these challenges often involve trade-offs between performance, consistency, and availability (as outlined by the **CAP Theorem**). A solid understanding of these issues and the techniques for handling them is essential for building resilient, high-performance distributed systems.

### 3. Design Web Crawler.
Designing a **web crawler** involves building a system that can automatically browse the web, extract useful data from web pages, and index them for various purposes (such as search engines, data scraping, or monitoring). A web crawler generally starts with a seed URL and recursively fetches linked pages, extracts data, and stores it for further use.

#### Approach to designing a web crawler.

#### 1. **Clarify the Requirements**

##### Functional Requirements:
- **Crawl Web Pages**: Start with a list of seed URLs and visit each page.
- **Extract Data**: Parse the content of each page to extract meaningful information, such as links, text, images, metadata, etc.
- **Store Data**: Store the extracted data in a structured format, such as a database or file system.
- **Follow Links**: Follow links (internal and external) to crawl other pages on the web.
- **Handle Duplicate Pages**: Avoid visiting the same page more than once.
- **Respect Robots.txt**: Ensure compliance with the **robots.txt** file, which specifies which pages can and cannot be crawled.
- **Handle Errors**: Properly handle network errors, missing pages (404s), and other failures.
- **Rate Limiting**: Crawl at a rate that doesn’t overwhelm the target websites (e.g., respect a delay between requests).
- **Multithreading/Concurrency**: To speed up crawling, multiple pages can be fetched in parallel.

##### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Scalability**: Should handle crawling large websites and millions of pages.
- **Performance**: The crawler should be efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system should be able to recover from errors like network failures.
- **Storage**: Store the crawled data efficiently for fast querying and future processing.


#### 2. **High-Level Architecture**

The architecture of a web crawler typically includes the following components:

1. **Crawl Frontier**:
   - A list of URLs to visit, also known as a **queue** or **frontier**.
   - Initially populated with seed URLs.
   - New URLs are added to the frontier as they are discovered on crawled pages.

2. **URL Fetcher**:
   - The component responsible for downloading web pages (i.e., sending HTTP requests).
   - Fetches HTML content from the URLs in the crawl frontier.
   - Can use libraries like **requests** in Python or **HttpClient** in Java.

3. **HTML Parser**:
   - Parses the fetched HTML content to extract relevant data, such as text, links, metadata, etc.
   - Can use libraries like **BeautifulSoup** in Python or **jsoup** in Java for this purpose.
   - Also extracts URLs (links) from the current page for further crawling.

4. **Data Extractor**:
   - Extracts meaningful content from the parsed HTML (e.g., titles, articles, images, etc.).
   - This can involve structured data extraction (like scraping product prices, news articles, etc.).

5. **Storage**:
   - **Database** or **NoSQL** store (like MongoDB or Elasticsearch) for storing crawled data.
   - Optionally, data can also be stored in flat files (like CSV, JSON, or HTML).

6. **URL Filter and Deduplication**:
   - Checks if a URL has been crawled previously to avoid duplicates.
   - Uses a **visited URL database** or an in-memory set (e.g., Redis) to track crawled URLs.
   - Also ensures that the crawler respects domain and path boundaries.

7. **Scheduler**:
   - Determines which URL should be crawled next and at what frequency (to avoid overloading any server).
   - Can prioritize URLs based on depth or importance.

8. **Robots.txt Parser**:
   - Ensures that the crawler adheres to the website's `robots.txt` rules.
   - Specifies which URLs can and cannot be crawled, ensuring compliance with web scraping best practices.


#### 3. **Component-Level Design**

##### **Crawler Flow**
1. **Initialization**:
   - The system starts with a list of seed URLs (e.g., a list of homepage URLs or domains).
   - The crawler loads these seed URLs into the **crawl frontier** (queue).

2. **URL Fetching**:
   - The **URL Fetcher** sends HTTP requests to fetch the HTML content from the frontier URLs.
   - The **robots.txt parser** checks the target domain's robots.txt file to ensure the page can be crawled.
   - If the target domain’s robots.txt allows crawling, the page is fetched.

3. **HTML Parsing and Link Extraction**:
   - The fetched HTML is passed to the **HTML Parser** to extract relevant content.
   - The parser identifies and extracts URLs from the `<a>` tags (links).
   - The parser can also extract other data, such as text, images, or structured data.

4. **Deduplication and Filtering**:
   - The extracted URLs are checked against a **visited URL list** or **set** to avoid revisiting pages.
   - The URLs are then filtered based on certain criteria (e.g., only internal links or specific subdirectories) to ensure proper crawling scope.

5. **URL Scheduling**:
   - The valid URLs that haven't been crawled yet are added to the **crawl frontier** (queue) for future crawling.
   - The scheduler decides the priority or depth at which the new URLs should be crawled.
   
6. **Data Storage**:
   - The extracted data is sent to the **Data Storage** component (e.g., NoSQL database) for future use (search indexing, data analysis, etc.).

7. **Concurrency and Parallelism**:
   - **Multithreading or Asynchronous Tasks**: Use multiple threads or asynchronous tasks (e.g., using Python’s `asyncio` or Java’s `ExecutorService`) to fetch URLs in parallel to speed up the crawling process.

##### **Error Handling and Retry Logic**:
- **Network Errors**: If a URL fetch fails due to network issues, the crawler should retry after a delay.
- **HTTP Errors**: Handle common HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500, etc.) gracefully. For some errors, the URL may be retried after a certain amount of time, while others might be skipped.
- **Timeouts**: Ensure requests are properly timed out to prevent the crawler from hanging indefinitely.

#### 4. **Web Crawler Data Flow**

1. **Crawl Frontier (Queue)**: Contains all the URLs to visit. It may prioritize URLs by page importance, freshness, or crawling depth.
2. **URL Fetcher**: Requests web pages based on the URLs in the crawl frontier.
3. **HTML Parser**: Parses the fetched HTML, extracting links and data.
4. **Link Extraction**: Identified links are added back to the crawl frontier (if they are not visited).
5. **Data Extraction**: Relevant data (text, images, etc.) is parsed and stored.
6. **Visited URLs**: Keeps track of which URLs have been visited to avoid re-crawling the same pages.

#### 5. **Robots.txt Compliance**

The crawler must check each domain's `robots.txt` file before crawling. This file specifies which parts of a website are off-limits for crawlers. The crawler should:
- Download and parse the `robots.txt` file.
- Check for `User-agent` entries that apply to the crawler.
- Follow `Disallow` rules and avoid crawling those pages.

#### 6. **Scalability and Performance**

- **Distributed Crawling**: As the scale increases, the crawler can be distributed across multiple machines, using a **distributed queue** (e.g., Kafka) and **distributed databases** (e.g., Hadoop, HBase) for large-scale data storage and retrieval.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for each domain to avoid overwhelming the web servers (using a delay between requests).
- **Storage Optimization**: Compress and store crawled data in a compact format (e.g., **JSON**, **Parquet** for large datasets) to save space.
- **Crawler Coordination**: For distributed crawlers, a coordinator manages which machines crawl which URLs.

#### 7. **Security and Legal Compliance**

- **Respect Website Terms**: Ensure the crawler adheres to legal and ethical guidelines, including respecting robots.txt and ensuring compliance with data privacy laws like GDPR.
- **Data Privacy**: Handle any personal data collected from web pages carefully and follow privacy guidelines.
- **Bot Detection**: Implement mechanisms to avoid being flagged as a bot, such as using **user-agent strings**, rotating **IP addresses** or **proxy usage**, and avoiding suspicious crawling patterns.


#### 8. **Monitoring and Logging**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track the crawler's performance, including URLs crawled, errors encountered, and data extraction statistics.
- **Logging**: Log every crawling event (successful/failed URL fetch, data extraction) for debugging and auditing purposes.
- **Error Handling**: Set up alerts for critical failures (e.g., 500 errors or network timeouts).


#### Pros:

A web crawler is a powerful tool for automating data collection from websites. The system needs to be efficient, scalable, and respectful of the websites it crawls. Key components include the **crawl frontier**, **URL fetcher**, **HTML parser**, **data extractor**, and **storage**. The crawler must also handle errors, deduplicate URLs, respect **robots.txt**, and provide a mechanism for scaling across multiple machines or processes for large-scale crawling.

##### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Simplicity**: The game should be easy to understand and play.
- **Responsiveness**: The game should respond quickly after each move.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Provide a clear and simple interface for interacting with the game.


#### 2. **High-Level Architecture**

The architecture of the game can be split into several components:

1. **Game Board**:
   - A 3x3 grid that holds the current state of the game (empty spaces, Xs, and Os).
   
2. **Player**:
   - Two players: Player X and Player O.
   - Players alternate turns until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - **Move Validation**: Ensures that players only mark empty spaces.
   - **Win Condition Check**: Determines if a player has won by checking all rows, columns, and diagonals.
   - **Draw Condition Check**: Determines if the game is a draw (when the grid is full and there’s no winner).

4. **UI/Display**:
   - **Grid Display**: Visually represent the 3x3 board.
   - **Player Turn Indicator**: Indicate whose turn it is.
   - **Game Result**: Display the result (win or draw).
   - **Restart Option**: Allow players to start a new game after the game ends.


#### 3. **Component-Level Design**

##### **Game Board**:
- The game board can be represented by a 2D array (3x3).
- Each cell in the array can have three states:
  - `' '` (empty)
  - `'X'` (player X's mark)
  - `'O'` (player O's mark)

Example representation:
```python
board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
```

##### **Player**:
- Each player will take turns marking a space on the board.
- Player X always goes first.
- The game alternates between Player X and Player O.

##### **Game Logic**:
- **Move Validation**: When a player chooses a position, check if it is empty. If the position is already occupied, prompt the player to choose another spot.
  
- **Win Condition**: A player wins if they have three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This can be checked after each move by checking the rows, columns, and diagonals.
  
  **Winning check logic**:
  - Check if all three cells in a row are the same (either 'X' or 'O').
  - Check if all three cells in a column are the same.
  - Check the two diagonals.

- **Draw Condition**: If all spaces are filled and there is no winner, the game is a draw.

##### **UI/Display**:
- **Game Board Display**: After every move, print the current state of the board.
- **Turn Display**: Indicate whose turn it is.
- **Result Display**: After the game ends, display the result (Win or Draw).
  
For example, you could represent the board as:
```
 X | O | X 
-----------
 O | X | O 
-----------
 O |   | X
```


#### 4. **Game Flow**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an empty 3x3 board.
   - Set the starting player as Player X.

2. **Player Turn**:
   - Display the board.
   - Indicate whose turn it is.
   - The player selects a position (row, column).
   - If the position is empty, place the player’s mark (X or O) on the board and proceed.
   - If the position is already occupied, prompt the player to choose another spot.

3. **Win Condition Check**:
   - After each move, check if the current player has won the game.
   - If a player wins, display the result and end the game.
   
4. **Draw Condition**:
   - If the board is full and no player has won, declare a draw.

5. **Restart**:
   - After a win or draw, prompt the players if they want to restart the game.


#### 5. **Algorithm for Winning Condition Check**

After each move, the system checks if the current player has won. Here’s how you can check:

1. **Check Rows**: If any row contains three identical marks (either 'X' or 'O'), that player wins.
2. **Check Columns**: If any column contains three identical marks, that player wins.
3. **Check Diagonals**: If either of the two diagonals contains three identical marks, that player wins.

##### Example Implementation:

##### **Python**:

```python
class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
        self.current_player = 'X'
        self.winner = None

    def display_board(self):
        print("\n")
        for row in self.board:
            print(" | ".join(row))
            print("---------")

        while True:
            self.display_board()
            print(f"Player {self.current_player}'s turn.")
            row, col = map(int, input("Enter row and column (0-2): ").split())
            
            if not self.make_move(row, col):
                continue

            if self.is_winner():
                self.display_board()
                print(f"Player {self.current_player} wins!")
                break
            elif self.is_draw():
                self.display_board()
                print("The game is a draw!")
                break
            
            self.switch_player()

            if input("Do you want to play again (y/n)? ").lower() != 'y':
                break


# Start the game

```

##### **JavaScript**:

```javascript
class TicTacToe {
    constructor() {
        this.board = [[' ', ' ', ' '], [' ', ' ', ' '], [' ', ' ', ' ']];

```

#### 6. **Scalability Considerations**

While Tic-Tac-Toe itself is a small-scale game, if the design were to be scaled (for example, with a larger grid size or multiple simultaneous games), you would need to:
- Store multiple game states (e.g., in a database or session storage).
- Implement multiplayer functionality for online play.
- Handle concurrency issues (e.g., ensuring two players can't take turns at the same time).


#### Pros:

This is a simple design for a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game. The key components of the design include:
- A **3x3 board** to hold game state.
- **Player management** for alternating turns.
- **Game logic** for determining winners, checking for a draw, and validating moves.
- A **simple user interface** that displays the current board and allows users to interact with the game.
- The game flow alternates between Player X and Player O, checking for win or draw conditions after every move.

### 6. Design Netflix.
Designing **Netflix** is a complex process, and we need to break it down into several parts to understand its architecture, core components, and how it scales to handle millions of users. Here’s an overview of how we can design a system like Netflix:

#### 1. **Key Features and Requirements**

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Users should be able to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Video Streaming**: The core functionality of Netflix is streaming videos to users across various devices.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Personalized recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for movies, shows, actors, genres, etc.
- **Subscriptions**: Different subscription plans with varying features (e.g., HD, UHD).
- **Content Management**: Admins can add or remove content, and metadata like title, description, actors, etc., are stored.
- **Playback Features**: Pause, resume, fast-forward, rewind, multiple devices (continue watching across devices).
- **Security and Privacy**: Protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Scalability**: Handle millions of users and data efficiently.

#### 2. **High-Level Architecture**

At a high level, Netflix can be divided into the following components:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Web, mobile, and smart TV applications.
   - User-facing interface for watching content, searching, recommendations, etc.
   - Communicates with the backend via APIs.

2. **Backend**:
   - **User Management**: Handles user registration, login, authentication, and authorization.
   - **Video Streaming**: Manages video delivery, buffering, adaptive bitrate streaming, etc.
   - **Content Management**: Stores information about videos, metadata, and updates.
   - **Recommendation Engine**: Recommends content to users based on preferences and history.
   - **Subscription Management**: Handles subscription plans, billing, and account management.

3. **Databases**:
   - **Relational Database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data like user profiles, billing information, subscription history.
   - **NoSQL Database** (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) for unstructured data like user viewing history, content metadata.
   - **Distributed File Storage** for storing video content, such as Amazon S3, HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), or a custom distributed file system.

4. **Caching**:
   - **Content Caching**: Store frequently accessed video data (for fast delivery) using CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and edge servers.
   - **Data Caching**: Cache user data and recommendations using systems like Redis or Memcached for faster access.

5. **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**:
   - Ensure low-latency streaming by caching and distributing content at edge locations across the globe.

6. **Load Balancers**:
   - Distribute user requests across backend servers to ensure the system scales and performs well under heavy load.

7. **Streaming Protocols**:
   - Use streaming protocols like **HLS** (HTTP Live Streaming) or **DASH** (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) for adaptive bitrate streaming.

8. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Collect metrics about user behavior, video consumption, system performance, etc.
   - Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting.


#### 3. **Detailed Component Design**

##### **User Authentication & Authorization**
- Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and manage subscriptions.
- Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization across devices.
- Support for multiple login methods (email/password, Google/Facebook login, etc.).

##### **Video Streaming Service**
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: The video quality should adjust based on the user’s internet speed.
- **Video Transcoding**: Convert videos into multiple formats and resolutions for optimal streaming (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p, 4K).
- **Buffering**: Implement a smart buffering mechanism to avoid interruptions during playback.
- **Streaming Protocols**: Use HLS/DASH for adaptive streaming based on the network conditions.

##### **Content Management System**
- **Admin Interface**: For content administrators to upload, categorize, and manage video content.
- **Metadata**: Include detailed information about the content, such as title, description, release year, genres, actors, ratings, etc.
- **Content Storage**: Videos are stored in a distributed storage system (like Amazon S3 or HDFS) that ensures high availability and durability.

##### **Recommendation System**
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend content based on user preferences and the viewing history of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend content based on similarities to what the user has already watched (e.g., similar genre or actors).
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine collaborative and content-based methods to improve recommendations.

##### **Search Functionality**
- Full-text search for movies, TV shows, and other content.
- Filters based on categories like genres, ratings, actors, and more.
- Autocomplete suggestions based on user input.

##### **Subscription & Billing**
- Handle multiple subscription plans, payment methods, and billing cycles (monthly, annual).
- Integrate with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) for processing payments.
- Track user subscriptions, billing, and usage.


#### 4. **Scalability & Performance**

##### **Horizontal Scaling**
- **Microservices**: Break down the backend into smaller microservices (e.g., user service, video service, recommendation service, payment service) to ensure horizontal scalability.
- **Database Sharding**: Use database sharding for splitting user data and video data across multiple databases.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Use CDN for fast video delivery by caching video content at edge locations closer to users.

##### **Caching**
- Use **CDNs** to cache videos at edge locations for fast access to content.
- Use **Redis** or **Memcached** for caching metadata, user preferences, and recommendations.
  
##### **Fault Tolerance and High Availability**
- Use **replication** for databases and **load balancing** across backend services to ensure high availability.
- Use **redundant video storage** systems (e.g., S3 with multiple regions) to ensure videos are always accessible.


#### 5. **Sequence Diagram / Flow**

1. **User Login**:
   - The user logs in via the frontend.
   - Backend verifies credentials and issues a token (JWT).
   - The user’s profile and preferences are fetched from the database.

2. **Video Streaming**:
   - User requests a video.
   - The backend authenticates the request, checks for subscription validity.
   - The video content is fetched from the CDN or video storage.
   - The appropriate video stream is provided based on the user’s device and internet speed (via HLS/DASH).
   
3. **Recommendation Flow**:
   - After each viewing session, user activity (views, likes, etc.) is logged.
   - The recommendation engine periodically processes this data and updates the user’s recommendations.
   - Recommendations are shown on the user interface.

4. **Search**:
   - The user inputs a query.
   - The backend performs a search on the video database and returns relevant results.
   - Filters and sorting options (genre, rating, etc.) are applied on the frontend.

#### 6. **Security Considerations**
- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS to encrypt user data in transit and encrypt video content at rest.
- **Token Expiry**: Use short-lived tokens and refresh tokens to ensure security.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API (e.g., brute force attacks).
- **Content Protection**: Use **DRM (Digital Rights Management)** technologies to prevent unauthorized access to video content.

#### 7. **Technologies**

- **Frontend**: React, React Native (for mobile), HTML5 Video Player
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (for APIs), Python (for recommendation algorithms)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL (user management), Cassandra or MongoDB (user activity, content metadata)
- **Video Streaming**: HLS/DASH, FFMPEG for transcoding
- **Caching**: Redis, Memcached
- **CDN**: Akamai, Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth2
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe, PayPal

#### 8. **Challenges**

1. **Global Distribution**: Ensuring smooth video playback for users worldwide with varying internet speeds.
2. **Real-Time Recommendation Updates**: Processing and delivering personalized recommendations in real-time based on user activity.
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensuring consistency across distributed databases and services while scaling.

#### Pros:
Designing a system like **Netflix** requires careful planning of both high-level components (video streaming, recommendation system) and low-level infrastructure (scalability, database design). By leveraging microservices, CDNs, caching strategies, and modern technologies, we can build a scalable and reliable system capable of handling millions of users and offering an immersive streaming experience.

### 7. Design a type-ahead search engine service.

Designing a **Type-Ahead Search Engine Service** (also known as **Autocomplete** or **Suggest-as-you-type**) involves enabling fast and efficient search suggestions based on partial input from users. The key is to ensure fast response times and scalability, especially when the dataset is large. Below is an overview of how to design such a service:

#### 1. **Features and Requirements**

- **Real-Time Suggestions**: As the user types a query, suggestions are displayed in real-time.
- **Fast Response Time**: The system should return search suggestions within milliseconds.
- **Scalability**: Handle large volumes of search data and a high rate of search requests.
- **Accuracy**: Provide accurate and relevant suggestions based on the user's input.
- **Ranking**: Suggestions should be ranked by popularity, relevance, or personalized preferences.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure the system can handle failures gracefully, especially under high load.

#### 2. **High-Level Architecture**

1. **Frontend**:
   - A web or mobile UI component where users type their search queries.
   - Display suggestions in real-time as users type.
   - Send API requests to the backend for search suggestions.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Search Suggestion API**: An API that receives the partial query and returns relevant suggestions.
   - **Search Index**: The core engine for storing searchable data (could be a search index like Elasticsearch or a custom indexing solution).
   - **Ranking Service**: A module responsible for ranking and filtering search results based on popularity, recency, or personalized preferences.
   - **Cache Layer**: A caching layer to store frequently accessed queries and results for fast retrieval (e.g., Redis or Memcached).

3. **Data Store**:
   - **Primary Data Store**: A NoSQL database like **Elasticsearch**, **Cassandra**, or **MongoDB** to store searchable items (such as product names, article titles, etc.).
   - **Cache**: A caching layer (e.g., **Redis**) for frequently queried suggestions.
   - **Logs and Analytics**: A system (e.g., **Kafka** + **Hadoop**) to capture and analyze user query patterns for future optimization.

4. **Indexing**:
   - **Search Index**: Index data efficiently using inverted indexing techniques for fast prefix search. Elasticsearch or Apache Solr can be used for this purpose.


#### 3. **Detailed Component Design**

##### **Search Suggestion API**
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/suggest`
- **Input**: Partial user input (e.g., "jav")
- **Output**: List of suggestions (e.g., ["Java", "JavaScript", "Java 8 features"])
- **Request Handling**:
  - The API takes the user input and queries the index for matching entries.
  - The suggestions are filtered, ranked, and sent back to the frontend.

##### **Search Indexing**
- **Indexing Process**:
  - Index documents that the user might search for (e.g., product names, article titles, or other searchable text).
  - Use a **trie** or **prefix tree** for efficient prefix matching.
  - **Inverted Index**: For large datasets, Elasticsearch provides an inverted index to perform fast prefix searches.
  
###### For example, if the dataset is:
  ```
  Java
  JavaScript
  Java 8 features
  Java Development
  ```

###### The inverted index might look like this:
  ```
  "J": ["Java", "JavaScript", "Java 8 features", "Java Development"]
  "Ja": ["Java", "JavaScript", "Java 8 features", "Java Development"]
  "Jav": ["Java", "JavaScript"]
  "Java": ["Java", "Java Development"]
  ```

##### **Ranking Algorithm**
- **Basic Ranking**: Rank suggestions based on relevance (e.g., prefix match). This could be as simple as returning the most frequent matches first.
- **Popularity-Based Ranking**: Rank based on search frequency, using counters to track how often each suggestion is searched for.
- **Personalized Suggestions**: Use machine learning to personalize suggestions based on user behavior (e.g., clicks, previous searches).
- **Recent Queries**: Show recent or trending queries if the user has no clear preference or to promote popular queries.
  
##### **Cache Layer**
- **Cache Design**:
  - Use **Redis** to cache the results of frequently queried prefixes.
  - Cache results for a short time to keep the system fast and responsive.
  - Cache key could be the query string, and the value would be the list of suggestions.
  
  For example, for the query `jav`, the cache key would be `jav` and the value would be the suggestions `["Java", "JavaScript"]`.

- **Cache Invalidation**: Cache should expire periodically to avoid serving stale results. Use a time-to-live (TTL) mechanism to refresh suggestions.


#### 4. **Scalability Considerations**

##### **Horizontal Scaling**
- **Microservices**: Break down the system into smaller services (e.g., one service for ranking, another for indexing, etc.) to scale independently.
- **Load Balancer**: Use load balancing to distribute requests across multiple instances of the backend services.
  
##### **Sharding and Replication**
- **Sharding**: For large-scale systems, shard the index based on certain criteria (e.g., alphabetically or by category).
- **Replication**: Use replication to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for the search index and cache layer.

##### **Handling Large Datasets**
- **Full-text Search**: For very large datasets, use search engines like **Elasticsearch** or **Apache Solr**, which are optimized for handling full-text search and autocomplete queries.
- **Batch Indexing**: For updates to the search index (like adding new products), use batch processing or stream processing frameworks to update the index periodically.


#### 5. **Fault Tolerance and High Availability**

- **Redundancy**: Use replication for both the search index and the cache layer to ensure availability in case of node failures.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If the search service is under heavy load, provide basic autocomplete suggestions or return cached results to ensure continued service.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups of search indexes and cache data to prevent data loss.


#### 6. **Sequence Diagram / Flow**

1. **User Interaction**:
   - User starts typing a query in the search bar (e.g., "jav").
   - The frontend sends a request to the backend: `/api/suggest?q=jav`.

2. **Backend Handling**:
   - The backend checks if the query is available in the cache.
     - If cached, return the cached suggestions.
     - If not cached, query the search index (e.g., Elasticsearch).
   - Rank the results based on popularity, relevance, and personalization.
   - Return the ranked suggestions to the frontend.

3. **Frontend**:
   - The frontend updates the UI to display suggestions in real-time.


#### 7. **Technologies**

- **Frontend**: React, Angular, or Vue.js for the user interface, with JavaScript to make asynchronous API calls for real-time suggestions.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Java (Spring Boot), Python (Flask/Django) for handling API requests.
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch, Apache Solr for fast text search and indexing.
- **Caching**: Redis or Memcached for caching frequent queries.

### 9. Design an API Rate Limiter system for GitHub or Firebase sites.
Designing an API rate limiter is crucial for protecting systems like **GitHub** or **Firebase** from abuse, ensuring fair usage, and preventing overloading of the servers. A rate limiter controls the number of API requests a user or client can make within a given time window. Below is a detailed design for a scalable, efficient, and reliable **API rate limiter**.

#### 1. **Core Requirements**
- **API Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests a user can make to the API within a defined period (e.g., 100 requests per hour).
- **Granular Control**: Different rate limits can apply for different API endpoints or user types (e.g., free users vs. premium users).
- **Throttle or Block Excess Requests**: Deny requests once a user exceeds their quota or throttle their access by slowing down responses.
- **Resets and Refreshes**: The limit should reset after a defined time window, e.g., 1 hour, or dynamically based on usage.
- **Global and Per-User Limits**: Enforce limits globally (for the entire API) as well as per user, IP address, or API key.
- **Scalability**: Handle millions of requests with low latency, especially with a large user base.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure high availability of the rate limiter service and prevent single points of failure.


#### 2. **Design Approach**

##### **1. API Rate Limiting Strategies**
There are several ways to implement API rate limiting. Below are the most common approaches:

- **Fixed Window Counter**: A user is allowed a certain number of requests in a fixed window of time (e.g., 100 requests per hour).
- **Sliding Window Log**: This method keeps a log of each request's timestamp and slides the window as time progresses. It's more accurate but can be more resource-intensive.
- **Token Bucket**: Tokens are added to a "bucket" at a fixed rate. Each request consumes one token. If the bucket is empty, the request is denied. This approach allows for bursts of traffic.
- **Leaky Bucket**: Similar to token bucket, but the bucket leaks at a constant rate. This can smooth out bursts of traffic and is more suitable for controlling the rate of requests over time.

For a scalable system, we typically use **Token Bucket** or **Sliding Window Log** as they balance fairness and performance well.


#### 3. **System Components**

##### **1. Rate Limiter API**
The Rate Limiter API will handle requests to check if a user has exceeded their quota. It will provide methods to:
- Check remaining requests.
- Record a request for a user.
- Retrieve information on their current limit status (e.g., how many requests they have left).

##### **2. Key Data Structures**
We need to track request usage and limits efficiently. Some of the key data structures are:
- **Hash Map (for each user/identifier)**: This will store the count of requests made in the current time window.
- **Time Window**: For Fixed Window, the system tracks the time window (e.g., 1 hour). For Sliding Window or Token Bucket, it tracks timestamps of requests or tokens available.
- **Redis (or distributed cache)**: A fast, in-memory database to handle data storage, especially for high throughput, as rate limits are typically time-sensitive.

##### **3. Rate Limiting Rules**
- **User-Specific Limits**: Different users or groups (e.g., free users, premium users) can have different rate limits. Store these in a central configuration file or a database.
- **Global Limits**: For popular API endpoints like login or sign-up, apply global rate limits to prevent abuse.
- **Endpoint-Specific Limits**: Some endpoints may require higher limits than others, e.g., API calls to fetch user data might have different limits than making changes to the user account.


#### 4. **Implementation Details**

##### **1. Token Bucket Algorithm**
Let’s use the **Token Bucket** algorithm as an example, which is one of the most widely used for API rate limiting.

- **Token Generation**: Tokens are added to the bucket at a fixed rate (e.g., 1 token per second).
- **Request Handling**: When a request arrives, the system checks if there are any tokens in the bucket.
  - If there are tokens, the request is allowed, and one token is removed.
  - If no tokens are available, the request is denied or delayed (if implemented with burst tolerance).
- **Bucket Overflow**: If the bucket is full, extra tokens are ignored, ensuring that the rate limit isn’t exceeded.

##### **2. Redis for Rate Limiting**
Use **Redis** as a caching layer to handle the fast writes/reads for tracking requests in real-time. Redis can store keys for users or IP addresses with expiration times, allowing for efficient rate limit tracking.

- **Key Format**: The key could be a combination of the user ID or IP address and the API endpoint. Example: `user:{user_id}:api_rate_limit:GET:/user/info`.
- **Token Bucket Example**: Redis can store the current token count and the last timestamp when tokens were added. If a request comes in, we check if the user has enough tokens and update the bucket accordingly.

##### **3. Rate Limiting API Workflow**
Here’s a simplified flow of handling an incoming API request:
1. **Identify User**: Extract the user ID or IP address from the request.
2. **Check Limits**: For the specific endpoint, check the user's current rate limit status (tokens available, or request count).
3. **Apply the Algorithm**:
   - **Fixed Window**: If the current time falls within the window, allow the request if the limit hasn't been exceeded.
   - **Token Bucket**: Check if tokens are available in the bucket. If available, allow the request; if not, deny it or enqueue it.
4. **Record Request**: Update the number of requests or token count.
5. **Return Response**: If the limit is exceeded, return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code with a message (and possibly retry-after information).

##### **4. Handling Bursts and Spikes**
- **Leaky Bucket** or **Token Bucket** can smooth out traffic spikes.
- Use a **Redis queue** or **backpressure mechanism** to control excessive bursts. If a user exceeds their request rate for an endpoint, introduce a delay or queue requests temporarily.


#### 5. **High-Level Architecture**

1. **API Gateway**: Routes API requests to the appropriate service and applies the rate-limiting logic.
   - Integrate rate limiting within the API Gateway or using middleware to intercept requests.
2. **Redis (or Distributed Cache)**: Store the rate limit state and user request history (e.g., request count or tokens).
3. **Rate Limiting Service**:
   - This service evaluates whether a request exceeds the user’s rate limit.
   - The service updates the rate limiting status in Redis for each user/API endpoint pair.
4. **Backend APIs**: The actual business logic APIs that are rate-limited by the system.


#### 6. **Scalability Considerations**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Ensure that the rate limiting service scales horizontally to handle high traffic loads by using **Redis clusters** or **distributed caches**.
- **Sharding**: To handle a large number of users, shard rate limit data by user ID or API key to ensure the system can handle millions of users efficiently.
- **Global Distribution**: For a globally distributed system (like GitHub or Firebase), use geographically distributed caches and storage, ensuring low-latency rate limiting.


#### 7. **Failure Handling & Resilience**
- **Redis Failover**: Implement Redis replication and failover to handle Redis outages or failures.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If the rate limiting service becomes temporarily unavailable, provide a fallback that allows users to perform a limited set of operations or temporarily relax rate limits.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Use a monitoring system to track the performance of the rate limiter and identify bottlenecks.


#### 8. **Example Workflow: Token Bucket Algorithm**
- **Step 1**: A request comes in for a user (identified by API key or IP address).
- **Step 2**: Check Redis to see if the user has any tokens left for the API endpoint.
- **Step 3**: If tokens are available, process the request, deduct one token from the user's bucket, and return a success response.
- **Step 4**: If no tokens are available, respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status, indicating that the rate limit has been exceeded.
- **Step 5**: The token bucket replenishes at a fixed rate over time, allowing the user to make additional requests after the replenishment interval.


#### 9. **Security and Best Practices**
- **Protect Against DOS Attacks**: Implement global rate limits for all users (e.g., limit the number of requests per minute per IP).
- **API Key Management**: Ensure that each request is linked to an authenticated user or API key, and apply separate rate limits to individual users, IPs, or keys.
- **Logging & Alerts**: Keep logs of rate limit violations and set up alerts to monitor for abnormal usage patterns.


#### 10. **Pros:**
By using an efficient algorithm such as **Token Bucket**, integrated with a fast, scalable storage layer like **Redis**, we can create a highly performant and distributed rate-limiting system. This system can prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and scale effectively even with millions of users, ensuring reliable service for platforms like **GitHub** or **Firebase**.

### 10. How do you design a recommendation system?
Designing a **recommendation system** involves creating a system that suggests items (products, services, content, etc.) to users based on various factors such as user preferences, item characteristics, and interactions with the system. Recommendation systems are widely used by companies like Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, etc., to provide personalized experiences. Below is a detailed design approach for a recommendation system:

#### 1. **Types of Recommendation Systems**
There are three primary types of recommendation systems:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: 
   - **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on the preferences of similar users.
   - **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items that are similar to items the user has liked or interacted with in the past.
   
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: 
   - Recommends items based on the features or characteristics of the items themselves (e.g., recommending movies with similar genres, directors, or actors).

3. **Hybrid Methods**: 
   - A combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. This approach aims to address the weaknesses of both individual methods and improve accuracy.


#### 2. **Key Components of a Recommendation System**

1. **User Profile**: 
   - **Demographics**: Information such as age, gender, location, etc. (For personalized recommendations)
   - **History**: Data about a user’s previous interactions, such as purchases, views, ratings, likes, etc.
   
2. **Item Profile**:
   - **Attributes**: Features like genre, description, price, etc., for each item.
   - **Metadata**: Tags, keywords, or other relevant information that can be used to describe the item.
   
3. **Interactions/Feedback**:
   - Data from user interactions (clicks, purchases, ratings, views, etc.) that can be used to infer preferences.

4. **Recommendation Algorithm**:
   - The core of the recommendation system, where machine learning, data analysis, or statistical methods are applied to generate recommendations.


#### 3. **Design Process of a Recommendation System**

##### **1. Data Collection**
- **User Data**: Collect data about users, including demographic data and behavioral data (e.g., searches, clicks, purchases, etc.).
- **Item Data**: Collect information about the items, such as attributes, descriptions, and metadata.
- **Interaction Data**: Track interactions between users and items, such as ratings, clicks, purchases, or views.

##### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- **Normalization**: Standardize data to ensure consistent formats and units (e.g., scaling ratings between 0-5).
- **Missing Data Handling**: Handle missing data in user interactions by using techniques like imputation or ignoring missing data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from raw data (e.g., creating a genre feature for movies, etc.).

##### **3. Recommendation Models**

###### **Collaborative Filtering**
- **Matrix Factorization**: One popular approach for collaborative filtering is matrix factorization, which decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into smaller matrices. Techniques such as **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** or **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** are often used.
  - **User-Item Interaction Matrix**: A matrix where rows represent users, columns represent items, and the cells contain ratings or interaction values. This matrix is often sparse (many missing values).
  - **Modeling**: Learn latent factors representing users and items and predict missing values in the matrix.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: 
  - For user-user or item-item collaborative filtering, the KNN algorithm can be used to find similar users or similar items based on historical data.

###### **Content-Based Filtering**
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A statistical method used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents. For items such as articles or movies, TF-IDF can be used to extract important features.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between the content of different items, such as calculating the cosine similarity between movies based on their features (e.g., genre, cast).
  
###### **Hybrid Methods**
- **Weighted Hybrid**: Combines both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, where each method is given a weight based on its accuracy or effectiveness.
- **Switching Hybrid**: Switches between the different methods based on the scenario (e.g., using collaborative filtering for active users and content-based filtering for new users).


#### 4. **Recommendation Generation Process**

##### **1. Collaborative Filtering Workflow (Matrix Factorization or KNN)**
   1. **Collect User-Item Interaction Data**: Gather historical interaction data (ratings, views, etc.).
   2. **Matrix Factorization**: Decompose the interaction matrix into smaller latent factor matrices (users and items).
   3. **Generate Predictions**: Predict missing values (ratings or interactions) in the user-item matrix.
   4. **Rank Items**: Based on predicted scores, rank the items for each user.
   5. **Filter and Recommend**: Filter items that are already interacted with (e.g., the user has already watched the movie), and recommend the top-ranked items.

##### **2. Content-Based Filtering Workflow**
   1. **Extract Item Features**: Extract features such as tags, genre, director, etc., for each item.
   2. **Calculate Similarity**: Calculate the similarity between items using cosine similarity or other similarity metrics.
   3. **Rank Items**: Rank items for each user based on the similarity to the items the user has already interacted with.
   4. **Filter and Recommend**: Recommend items with the highest similarity scores.

##### **3. Hybrid System Workflow**
   1. **Model User Preferences**: Use both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to model user preferences.
   2. **Generate Recommendations**: Combine the recommendations from both models, either by weighting or by selecting the best method for each user.
   3. **Filter and Recommend**: Provide the final recommendations to the user.


#### 5. **Evaluation Metrics**
To assess the effectiveness of the recommendation system, various evaluation metrics are used:
- **Precision**: The fraction of recommended items that are relevant to the user.
- **Recall**: The fraction of relevant items that are recommended to the user.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual ratings.
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual ratings.


#### 6. **Scalability Considerations**
- **Distributed Computing**: Use distributed systems (e.g., **Apache Spark**, **Hadoop**) for handling large datasets.
- **Data Sharding**: Split the user and item data across multiple servers to distribute the load.
- **Caching**: Cache frequent requests (e.g., most popular recommendations) to improve response time.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement systems to update recommendations in real-time as users interact with the system.
- **Personalization**: Implement **online learning** where the system learns and updates the user preferences continuously as new interactions come in.


#### 7. **Handling Cold Start Problem**
The cold start problem arises when a new user or item enters the system and there is insufficient data for generating recommendations. To handle this:
- **Content-Based Filtering for New Users**: Use user demographics (age, gender, etc.) and recommend items based on similarity to their profile.
- **Popular Items**: Recommend popular items to new users until enough data is collected.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combine content-based methods for new users with collaborative filtering once sufficient data is available.


#### 8. **System Architecture**
A basic recommendation system architecture can look like this:

1. **Frontend**: User interface to interact with the system (web, mobile apps).
2. **API Layer**: Handles user requests and queries the recommendation engine.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Core system responsible for generating recommendations based on collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods.
4. **Data Store**: Stores user data, item data, interaction data, and recommendation results.
5. **Machine Learning Model**: The recommendation algorithm model, trained on historical data to generate predictions.
6. **Monitoring & Logging**: Tracks system performance, metrics, and user feedback.


#### 9. **Pros:**
Designing a recommendation system involves careful consideration of the algorithm (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid), scalability, data collection, and evaluation. A well-designed recommendation system can significantly enhance user experience by providing personalized and relevant suggestions.

    - `process_payment()`: Processes the payment and updates the payment status.


#### **4. Parking Lot System Flow**

1. **Vehicle Entry**:
   - When a vehicle enters the parking lot, the system should find an available parking spot.
   - If a spot is available, a ticket is issued with the entry time recorded.
   - The vehicle is assigned a parking spot, and the system updates the available spots.
   
2. **Vehicle Exit**:
   - When the vehicle exits, the system records the exit time and calculates the parking fee based on the time the vehicle spent in the parking lot.
   - The payment is processed (either manually or through a payment gateway), and the spot is marked as available.
   - The system then updates the available spots list.

3. **Parking Fee Calculation**:
   - The fee can be calculated based on various factors such as time of stay, vehicle type, and parking lot policies.
   - Example: A car may be charged $2 per hour, while a motorcycle may be charged $1 per hour.

4. **Spot Availability and Notifications**:
   - The system should notify users when there are no available spots, or when spots become available.
   - It can also notify when the parking lot is full.


#### **5. Design Considerations and Scalability**

- **Multi-Level Parking**: 
  - A parking lot might have multiple levels or zones. The system should be able to manage parking in each level, especially when space on a particular level is full.
  
- **Real-Time Tracking**:
  - The system must track each vehicle in real-time, recording the exact entry and exit time, which could be done using a combination of databases and real-time data structures (queues, sets).
  
- **Payments and Billing**:
  - Implement a billing system for handling fees. Payment can be through cash, card, or an integrated mobile app.
  
- **Concurrency and Scalability**:
  - Use a database management system (DBMS) to store parking data. Consider **partitioning** for large parking lots or distributed storage for multi-location systems.
  - Use **caching** for real-time availability of parking spots to avoid redundant database queries.
  
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Full Parking Lot**: The system should alert the user if the lot is full and provide an option to be notified when a spot becomes available.
  - **Overstay**: Ensure that vehicles are tracked for exceeding their parking duration, and bill them accordingly.


#### **6. Database Schema Design**

1. **ParkingLots**:

   - `exit_time`

4. **Tickets**:
   - `ticket_id` (PK)
   - `vehicle_id` (FK)
   - `entry_time`
   - `exit_time`
   - `payment_status` (paid/unpaid)
   - `fee`


#### **7. Example System Flow**

##### Python: 
```python
class ParkingLot:
    def __init__(self, total_spots):
        self.total_spots = total_spots
        self.available_spots = [i for i in range(total_spots)]
        self.vehicle_records = {}

    def find_available_spot(self):
        return self.available_spots.pop() if self.available_spots else None

    def vehicle_entry(self, vehicle):
        spot = self.find_available_spot()
        if spot is not None:
            self.vehicle_records[vehicle.license_plate] = {'spot': spot, 'entry_time': datetime.now()}
            print(f"Vehicle {vehicle.license_plate} assigned to spot {spot}.")
            return True
        else:
            print("No available spots.")
            return False

    def vehicle_exit(self, vehicle):
        record = self.vehicle_records.pop(vehicle.license_plate, None)
        if record:
            exit_time = datetime.now()
            fee = vehicle.calculate_parking_fee(record['entry_time'], exit_time)
            print(f"Vehicle {vehicle.license_plate} exited. Fee: {fee}")
            self.available_spots.append(record['spot'])
            return fee
        else:
            print(f"No entry record for vehicle {vehicle.license_plate}.")
            return None

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, license_plate, type):
        self.license_plate = license_plate
        self.type = type

    def calculate_parking_fee(self, entry_time, exit_time):
        duration = (exit_time - entry_time).seconds / 3600  # in hours
        fee_per_hour = 2 if self.type == "car" else 1
        return fee_per_hour * duration

# Usage
lot = ParkingLot(10)
car = Vehicle("ABC123", "car")
lot.vehicle_entry(car)

# Simulate parking time
time.sleep(5)  # assume 5 seconds for simplicity
lot.vehicle_exit(car)
```

##### JavaScript:

```javascript
class ParkingLot {
    constructor(totalSpots) {
        this.totalSpots = totalSpots;
        this.availableSpots = Array.from({ length: totalSpots }, (_, i) => i);
        this.vehicleRecords = {};
    }

    findAvailableSpot() {
        return this.availableSpots.pop() || null;
    }

    vehicleEntry(vehicle) {
        const spot = this.findAvailableSpot();
        if (spot !== null) {
            this.vehicleRecords[vehicle.licensePlate] = {
                spot: spot,
                entryTime: new Date()
            };
            console.log(`Vehicle ${vehicle.licensePlate} assigned to spot ${spot}.`);
            return true;
        } else {
            console.log("No available spots.");
            return false;
        }
    }

    vehicleExit(vehicle) {
        const record = this.vehicleRecords[vehicle.licensePlate];
        if (record) {
            const exitTime = new Date();
            const fee = vehicle.calculateParkingFee(record.entryTime, exitTime);
            console.log(`Vehicle ${vehicle.licensePlate} exited. Fee: $${fee}`);
            this.availableSpots.push(record.spot);
            delete this.vehicleRecords[vehicle.licensePlate];
            return fee;
        } else {
            console.log(`No entry record for vehicle ${vehicle.licensePlate}.`);
            return null;
        }
    }
}

class Vehicle {
    constructor(licensePlate, type) {
        this.licensePlate = licensePlate;
        this.type = type;
    }

    calculateParkingFee(entryTime, exitTime) {
        const durationInHours = (exitTime - entryTime) / (1000 * 3600); // in hours
        const feePerHour = this.type === 'car' ? 2 : 1;
        return feePerHour * durationInHours;
    }
}

// Example usage
const lot = new ParkingLot(10);
const car = new Vehicle("ABC123", "car");

// Vehicle enters the lot
lot.vehicleEntry(car);

// Simulate parking time (5 seconds)
setTimeout(() => {
    // Vehicle exits the lot
    lot.vehicleExit(car);
}, 5000);
```

#### **8. Pros:**

This design provides a fundamental parking lot system, focusing on managing parking spots, vehicles, and billing. It can be extended further to include features such as subscription plans, advanced security (e.g., license plate recognition), real-time monitoring, and mobile app integration for better user experience.

### 12. Design Facebook’s newsfeed system.
Designing **Facebook’s Newsfeed System** involves building a scalable, efficient, and personalized system that fetches and displays content (posts, images, videos, etc.) to users. The goal is to display relevant and timely content based on a user's interests, connections, and activities, while also ensuring the system can handle massive amounts of traffic and data.

#### Approach to design the Facebook Newsfeed system:

#### **1. Key Requirements**
- **User Interaction**: Users can create posts, like, comment, and share posts.
- **Personalized Feed**: Each user should see a customized newsfeed based on their preferences and relationships.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle billions of users, posts, and interactions in real-time.
- **Efficiency**: The system should quickly retrieve posts while reducing load times.
- **Data Freshness**: Newsfeed should display recent posts but also consider engagement patterns (e.g., popular posts).
- **Real-time Updates**: The feed should update in real-time or near real-time as new posts are made or interactions occur.

#### **2. Core Components and Design**

##### **Entities/Objects**:
1. **User**: Represents a user on the platform.
   - `user_id`: Unique identifier.
   - `friends`: List of friends (user_ids).
   - `followers`: List of users who follow the user.
   - `preferences`: User-defined preferences (e.g., categories of posts they prefer).

2. **Post**: Represents a post made by a user.
   - `post_id`: Unique identifier.
   - `user_id`: ID of the user who made the post.
   - `content`: Content of the post (text, images, videos).
   - `timestamp`: The time the post was created.
   - `likes`: List of users who liked the post.
   - `comments`: List of comments on the post.

3. **Newsfeed**: A stream of posts for a user.
   - A combination of **friends’ posts**, **sponsored content**, and **recommended posts**.
   - Can include real-time updates based on interactions (likes, shares, comments).


#### **3. System Design Overview**

##### **Feed Generation**:
To generate the newsfeed for a user, we need to consider the following:
- **Friends’ Posts**: The most common source of content in the feed is from the user’s friends. A user should see posts from their direct connections (friends).
- **User Engagement**: The feed should prioritize content that a user interacts with more (e.g., likes, comments, shares).
- **Sponsored Content**: Advertisers should be able to place ads in the newsfeed. The ads should be relevant to the user based on their interests and behaviors.
- **Trending Content**: Popular posts (based on likes, shares, comments) from across the platform that the user may be interested in.
- **Machine Learning/Recommendation System**: Posts that are personalized for a user based on past activity and engagement.


#### **4. Design Steps**

##### **1. Data Model Design**
The data model should be designed for efficient retrieval of posts and interactions:

- **Post Table/Collection**:
  - `post_id` (primary key)
  - `user_id`
  - `content`
  - `timestamp`
  - `likes_count`
  - `comments_count`

- **User Table/Collection**:
  - `user_id`
  - `friends` (list of friend IDs)
  - `followers` (list of follower IDs)
  - `preferences` (user interests)
  - `last_active_time`

- **Feed Table/Collection** (Materialized view or cache):
  - `user_id`
  - `post_id`
  - `timestamp` (when the post was added to the user’s feed)
  - `priority_score` (score based on relevance to user)

##### **2. Post Insertion and Feed Update**
When a user creates a new post:
- **Post Creation**:
  - Add the post to the `Posts` table.
  - Generate newsfeeds for all of their friends and followers.
  
- **Feed Generation**:
  - For each user’s feed, include posts from:
    - The user’s friends.
    - Sponsored content (ads).
    - Recommended posts based on the user’s preferences, interactions, or external factors (trending content).

##### **3. Ranking and Prioritization of Posts**
- **Ranking Criteria**:
  - **Recency**: Newer posts are given higher priority, but this can be adjusted based on other factors like engagement.
  - **Engagement**: Posts that have more likes, comments, and shares are more likely to be shown higher in the feed.
  - **User Interaction**: Posts that the user has interacted with in the past (liked, commented, or shared) should be prioritized.
  - **Friendship/Connection Strength**: Content from close friends or frequent interactors should be prioritized over posts from distant connections.
  - **Relevance**: Use machine learning models to determine the relevance of posts to a user (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering).
  
- **Algorithm**:
  - Use a **weighted scoring system** where different factors contribute to the priority score of each post.
  - Example: `priority_score = w1 * engagement_score + w2 * recency_score + w3 * user_interaction_score + ...`

##### **4. Caching and Efficient Retrieval**
- **Cache the Feed**: Store each user's feed in a cache (e.g., Redis) to reduce retrieval time for frequently accessed data.
- **Pagination**: Load the feed in chunks (e.g., 20 posts at a time) to ensure fast loading and to support infinite scroll.

##### **5. Real-Time Updates**
- **WebSockets/Push Notifications**: Use WebSockets or push notifications to notify users of new posts or interactions (likes, comments, etc.).
- **Event-Driven System**: When a user likes, comments, or shares a post, the system should:
  - Update the post's rank.
  - Push the update to the user’s feed if necessary (e.g., prioritize the post higher in the feed).

##### **6. Handling Scale**
- **Sharding**: Partition the data to handle large amounts of posts and users. For example:
  - **User Sharding**: Partition user data based on geographical location or user ID.
  - **Post Sharding**: Partition posts by time or by post ID.
  
- **Distributed Storage**: Use distributed databases like Cassandra or DynamoDB for storing posts and feed data to handle scale.

- **Real-Time Analytics**: Use Apache Kafka or other event streaming systems to track user interactions and update the feeds accordingly.


#### **5. Example Flow**

1. **User A creates a post**:
   - Add the post to the database.
   - Recalculate newsfeeds for User A's friends.
   - If the post has high engagement, promote it to other users who may be interested based on machine learning models.

2. **User B checks their newsfeed**:
   - Retrieve the top N posts from the cache or database based on the calculated priority score.
   - Show the posts on the frontend.

3. **User B interacts with a post** (likes, comments, shares):
   - Update the post’s priority score.
   - Recalculate the feed ranking and push the update in real-time to User B’s feed.


#### **6. Example Schema and Code**

- **Post Schema**:
  ```json
  {
    "post_id": "12345",
    "user_id": "user123",
    "content": "This is a new post!",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-14T15:00:00Z",
    "likes_count": 10,
    "comments_count": 5
  }
  ```

- **User Schema**:
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "user123",
    "friends": ["user456", "user789"],
    "followers": ["user456"],
    "preferences": ["tech", "sports"],
    "last_active_time": "2025-02-14T14:50:00Z"
  }
  ```

#### **7. Pros:**
Designing a Facebook Newsfeed system requires handling personalization, scalability, and real-time updates. The key components include:
- Ranking posts based on user engagement, recency, and relevance.
- Efficiently managing user data and post data via caching and sharding.
- Real-time updates through push notifications or WebSockets.
- A personalized feed that adapts to user interests and activities.

This design can be extended with more advanced features like sentiment analysis, deep learning-based recommendations, and handling multimedia content.

### 14. How do you design a URL shortening service like TinyURL or bit.ly?

Designing a URL shortening service like TinyURL or Bit.ly involves creating a system that can take a long URL and generate a unique, shorter alias that redirects users to the original URL. 

### How to design URL Shortening Service:

#### **1. System Requirements**

##### **Functional Requirements:**
- **Shorten URLs**: Allow users to input a long URL and generate a short, unique alias.
- **Redirect**: When users visit the shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original URL.
- **Analytics**: Track the number of times a shortened URL is clicked, where the clicks come from, and when it was clicked.
- **Customization**: Allow users to customize the shortened URL (optional).
- **Expiration**: Support URL expiration (optional).
  
##### **Non-functional Requirements:**
- **Scalability**: The system must handle millions of URLs efficiently.
- **High Availability**: Ensure minimal downtime to avoid the unavailability of shortened URLs.
- **Security**: Prevent abuse, such as spamming, by adding features like CAPTCHA, rate-limiting, etc.
- **Fast Lookups**: Ensure very fast redirects to avoid latency issues.

#### **2. High-Level Architecture**

##### **Components:**
1. **API Layer**:
   - Provides endpoints for shortening URLs, retrieving original URLs, and tracking analytics.
2. **Database**:
   - Stores mappings between short URLs and original URLs.
   - Tracks click analytics and metadata.
3. **Caching Layer**:
   - To speed up frequent lookups, cache the short URL and its corresponding long URL.
4. **Web Server**:
   - Handles the HTTP requests for both shortening URLs and redirecting.
5. **Analytics Service**:
   - Tracks user clicks on shortened URLs for analytics purposes.
6. **Authentication & Authorization** (optional):
   - For premium features like custom aliases, analytics, etc.

#### **3. Schema Design**

##### **URL Mapping Table**:
- **URL Mapping Table** stores the mapping between a shortened URL and the original URL.

```json
{
  "short_url_id": "abcd123",       // Unique identifier for the short URL
  "original_url": "http://example.com/some/very/long/url",  // The original long URL
  "creation_time": "2025-02-14T15:00:00Z", // Timestamp of when the short URL was created
  "expiration_time": "2025-02-15T00:00:00Z", // Optional: expiration time
  "custom_alias": "custom-url",    // Optional: custom alias if user chooses one
  "click_count": 100               // The number of times the shortened URL has been clicked
}
```

##### **Analytics Table** (Optional):
- **Analytics Table** tracks metadata about the click (e.g., timestamp, IP address, location).

```json
{
  "click_id": "xyz789",             // Unique click identifier
  "short_url_id": "abcd123",        // The short URL clicked
  "timestamp": "2025-02-14T15:05:00Z", // Timestamp of when the click happened
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",      // IP address of the user who clicked
  "location": "New York, USA"       // Location of the user (optional)
}
```


#### **4. Flow of the System**

##### **Shortening a URL**:
1. The user submits a long URL via the API.
2. The system generates a unique identifier (short URL ID). This could be done by:
   - **Hashing** the original URL.
   - Using a **counter-based** approach (increment a counter, encode it into a short URL).
   - **Random string generation** for unique URLs.
3. The generated short URL is saved in the database, along with the mapping to the original URL.
4. If the user requests a custom short URL, ensure it is unique and store it.
5. Return the shortened URL (e.g., `http://short.ly/abcd123`).

##### **Redirecting to the Original URL**:
1. When a user visits a shortened URL, the system extracts the unique part (e.g., `abcd123`) from the URL.
2. The system looks up the short URL ID in the database.
3. If found, it redirects the user to the corresponding long URL.
4. Optionally, track the click in the analytics system (IP address, timestamp, etc.).
5. If the URL is not found or expired, return an error or a “not found” page.


#### **5. URL Generation Strategies**

##### **1. Base62 Encoding**:
- Use **Base62 encoding** (characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9) to generate the shortened URL.
- For example, instead of using numeric IDs, a counter value (e.g., `12345`) could be encoded into a Base62 string (e.g., `dnhT2`). This ensures the URL is short and contains a mix of upper/lowercase letters and numbers.

##### **2. Hashing**:
- **MD5, SHA256**: Hash the original URL and then take the first 6–8 characters of the hash.
- Ensure uniqueness by checking the hash against existing ones in the database.

##### **3. Random String Generation**:
- Generate a random string of 6–8 alphanumeric characters for the shortened URL.
- Check if the string already exists; if it does, generate a new one.

##### **4. Custom Aliases**:
- Allow users to specify their own aliases (e.g., `short.ly/mycustomurl`).
- Ensure the alias is unique, and store it in the database.


#### **6. System Design Considerations**

##### **1. Database**:
- **Primary Database**: Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for storing URL mappings.
- **Schema**: Two main tables—`URLs` (mapping short URL IDs to long URLs) and `Analytics` (storing click data).
- **Sharding**: For scalability, consider sharding the database based on short URL IDs or using partitioning strategies.
- **Indexing**: Index the URL columns to speed up the search for short URLs.

##### **2. Caching**:
- Use a caching system like **Redis** to store frequently accessed shortened URLs and their corresponding long URLs. This ensures faster redirects for popular URLs.
- Cache expiration times can be set based on your business logic.

##### **3. Scalability**:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: As the service grows, add more application servers behind load balancers.
- **Database Sharding**: Divide the URL mapping data into multiple databases to handle large-scale traffic.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Use CDNs to serve assets quickly (especially if the service starts including media content).

##### **4. Rate Limiting & Security**:
- Implement **rate limiting** (e.g., using Redis or API Gateway) to prevent spamming.
- Use **CAPTCHA** or **email verification** for user-generated content (custom URLs).
- Ensure URLs are sanitized to prevent malicious URLs and security breaches (e.g., URL injections).

##### **5. Analytics**:
- Track important metrics like the number of clicks per URL, geographical data, referral sources, and device types.
- Use **asynchronous processing** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to handle large volumes of analytics data without affecting the performance of the system.


#### **7. Technologies**

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (for user interface).
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), Python (Flask/Django), or Java (Spring Boot) for API services.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB (NoSQL) for scalable storage.
- **Cache**: Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for URL lookups and analytics.
- **Message Queue**: Kafka or RabbitMQ for handling background jobs (like analytics tracking).
- **Authentication**: JWT for user authentication if required for premium features.


#### **8. Example API Endpoints**

- **POST /shorten**: Accepts a long URL and returns a shortened URL.
  - **Input**: `{ "url": "http://example.com" }`
  - **Response**: `{ "short_url": "http://short.ly/abcd123" }`

- **GET /{short_url}**: Redirects to the original URL based on the short URL.
  - **Input**: `http://short.ly/abcd123`
  - **Response**: Redirect to `http://example.com`

- **GET /analytics/{short_url}**: Returns analytics for the shortened URL.
  - **Input**: `http://short.ly/abcd123`
  - **Response**: `{ "click_count": 100, "clicks_by_country": { "USA": 80, "Canada": 20 } }`


This design focuses on scalability, high availability, and fast redirection while considering security and user-friendliness. You can enhance the system with features like URL expiration, password protection for links, or personalized URL creation based on user accounts.

- **Presence Information**: Show when a user is online, typing, or last seen.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensure that messages are encrypted, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Message History**: Allow users to view the history of messages sent in a chat.


#### **3. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Scalability**: The system must support millions of users and handle high traffic.
- **Reliability**: Ensure high availability with minimal downtime.
- **Low Latency**: Deliver messages in real-time or near real-time.
- **Security**: Messages should be end-to-end encrypted.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure privacy for user information, messages, and media.


#### **4. Database Design**

##### **Entities:**
1. **Users**: Store user information like ID, username, password (hashed), contact list, etc.
2. **Messages**: Store message details like sender, receiver, content, timestamp, and read status.
3. **Groups**: Store information about group chats, including group members and group settings.
4. **Media**: Store file metadata (image, video, etc.) and its URL (link to a media storage service).
5. **Presence**: Store user online/offline status and activity (e.g., typing).
6. **Contacts**: Manage user contacts and their relationship.

##### **Schema Design:**

- **Users Table**:
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "user123",
    "username": "JohnDoe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "phone_number": "+123456789",
    "profile_picture": "url/to/profile.jpg",
    "contacts": ["user456", "user789"],
    "status": "Online"
  }
  ```

- **Messages Table**:
  ```json
  {
    "message_id": "msg123",
    "sender_id": "user123",
    "receiver_id": "user456",
    "content": "Hello!",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-14T15:00:00Z",
    "media_url": "url/to/media.jpg",
    "is_read": false
  }
  ```

- **Groups Table**:
  ```json
  {
    "group_id": "group123",
    "group_name": "Family Chat",
    "group_members": ["user123", "user456", "user789"],
    "admin_id": "user123",
    "created_at": "2025-02-14T15:00:00Z"
  }
  ```


#### **5. System Design**

##### **Real-Time Messaging (WebSocket or MQTT)**:
- **WebSockets** or **MQTT** can be used for real-time communication between the client and the server. These protocols allow two-way communication, where the server can send messages to the client instantly.
- Clients maintain a persistent WebSocket connection to the server, allowing for low-latency message delivery.

##### **Message Delivery and Queueing**:
- To handle high traffic and ensure message delivery, use a message queueing system like **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, or **Amazon SQS**.
- The queue ensures that even if a user is offline, the message will be stored and delivered once the user comes online.

##### **Push Notifications**:
- Use services like **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** or **Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)** to send push notifications to users' devices when they receive new messages.

##### **Message Storage and Sync**:
- Store the messages in the database in a way that supports fast access and retrieval.
- For **offline users**, store undelivered messages in a queue and sync them when the user comes online.
- For **scalability**, use a **NoSQL database** like **Cassandra** or **MongoDB** to store message data, as they can scale horizontally and handle high throughput.

##### **End-to-End Encryption**:
- Use end-to-end encryption (e.g., **AES** or **RSA**) to ensure that messages can only be read by the sender and receiver.
- Encryption and decryption should happen on the client-side, ensuring the server never has access to the message content.


#### **6. Features Implementation**

##### **1. User Registration & Authentication**:
- Users can register using phone numbers or email.
- Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication and session management.
- Allow users to manage their profile (username, profile picture, status).

##### **2. Real-Time Messaging**:
- Use **WebSockets** or **MQTT** for message delivery.
- Messages are delivered in real-time between users or groups.
- Keep track of the **read status** of each message (seen vs. unread).

##### **3. Group Chats**:
- Users can create groups and invite others.
- Store group membership, messages, and group-specific settings.
- Implement features like **admin control** (adding/removing members, changing group settings).

##### **4. Media Sharing**:
- Users can upload images, videos, or documents.
- Use a **cloud storage service** (e.g., **Amazon S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**) to store media files.
- Store the **file metadata** in the database, linking to the actual media URL.

##### **5. Presence Information**:
- Track whether a user is **online** or **offline**.
- Show the **last seen** status or real-time typing indicators for users.


#### **7. Scalability Considerations**

- **Database Sharding**: To scale horizontally, divide the user and message data into different shards. Shard the database by user IDs or message IDs.
- **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple application servers.
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, contacts, recent messages) using a **distributed cache** like **Redis**.
- **Distributed Systems**: Use **distributed file storage** (e.g., **Amazon S3**) for media to handle large amounts of data and ensure low-latency access.


#### **8. Technologies**

- **Frontend**: React, React Native, or Flutter for cross-platform mobile and web apps.
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), Python (Flask/Django), or Java (Spring Boot) for API services.
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL), PostgreSQL (Relational), or Cassandra (NoSQL for scaling).
- **Message Queue**: Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing and message delivery guarantees.
- **WebSockets/MQTT**: For real-time communication.
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or APNS.
- **Cloud Storage**: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage for media file storage.
- **Encryption**: AES/RSA for end-to-end encryption.


#### **9. API Design**

##### **POST /register**:
- **Input**: User registration data (phone number/email, password).
- **Response**: Success message and JWT for authentication.

##### **POST /send-message**:
- **Input**: `{ "sender_id": "user123", "receiver_id": "user456", "message": "Hello", "media": null }`
- **Response**: Success or error message.

##### **GET /receive-message**:
- **Input**: `{ "user_id": "user123" }`
- **Response**: List of messages, including their read status and timestamp.

##### **GET /contacts**:
- **Input**: `{ "user_id": "user123" }`
- **Response**: List of contacts with their online/offline status.

##### **POST /create-group**:
- **Input**: `{ "group_name": "Family", "members": ["user123", "user456"] }`
- **Response**: Group ID and group details.


#### **10. Example Workflow**

1. **User 1** sends a message to **User 2**.
2. The system stores the message in the database, and the message is sent via WebSocket to **User 2**.
3. If **User 2** is offline, the message is stored in a message queue and delivered when they come online.
4. **User 2** receives the message instantly (via WebSocket) or after reconnecting.
5. Both users' devices display the message with real-time updates on read status.

This design focuses on scalability, low-latency communication, and security while providing essential features like media sharing, presence, and encryption.
